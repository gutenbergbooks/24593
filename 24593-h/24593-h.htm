<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapisml"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>N a beautiful distant kingdom,
of which there is a saying,
that the sun on its everlasting
green gardens never goes down,
ruled, from the beginning of
time even to the present day,
Queen Phantasie. With full hands, she used
to distribute for many hundred years, the abundance
of her blessings among her subjects,
and was beloved and respected by all who
knew her. The heart of the Queen, however,
was too great to allow her to stop at
her own land with her charities; she herself,
in the royal attire of her everlasting youth
and beauty, descended upon the earth; for
she had heard that there men lived, who
passed their lives in sorrowful seriousness, in
the midst of care and toil. Unto these she
had sent the finest gifts out of her kingdom,
and ever since the beauteous Queen came
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg&nbsp;8]</a></span>
through the fields of earth, men were merry
at their labor, and happy in their seriousness.</p>

<p>Her children, moreover, not less fair and
lovely than their royal mother, she had sent
forth to bring happiness to men. One day
M&auml;rchen<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>, the eldest daughter of the Queen,
came back in haste from the earth. The
mother observed that M&auml;rchen was sorrowful;
yes, at times it would seem to her as if her
eyes would be consumed by weeping.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with thee, beloved
M&auml;rchen?&rdquo; said the Queen to her. &ldquo;Ever
since thy journey, thou art so sorrowful and
dejected; wilt thou not confide to thy mother
what ails thee?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! dear mother,&rdquo; answered M&auml;rchen,
&ldquo;I would have kept silence, had I not known
that my sorrow is thine also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak, my daughter!&rdquo; entreated the fair
Queen. &ldquo;Grief is a stone, which presses
down him who bears it alone, but two draw
it lightly out of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou wishest it,&rdquo; rejoined M&auml;rchen, &ldquo;so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span>
listen. Thou knowest how gladly I associate
with men, how cheerfully I sit down before
the huts of the poor, to while away a little
hour for them after their labor; formerly,
when I came, they used to ask me kindly for
my hand to salute, and looked upon me afterwards,
when I went away, smiling and contented;
but in these days, it is so no longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor M&auml;rchen!&rdquo; said the Queen as she
caressed her cheek, which was wet with a
tear. &ldquo;But, perhaps, thou only fanciest all
this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me, I feel it but too well,&rdquo; rejoined
M&auml;rchen; &ldquo;they love me no more. Wherever
I go, cold looks meet me; nowhere am I
any more gladly seen; even the children, who
ever loved me so well, laugh at me, and slyly
turn their backs upon me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen leaned her forehead on her
hand, and was silent in reflection. &ldquo;And how,
then, M&auml;rchen,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;should it happen
that the people there below have become so
changed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, O Queen Phantasie! men have stationed
vigilant watchmen, who inspect and
examine all that comes from thy kingdom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg&nbsp;10]</a></span>
with sharp eyes. If one should arrive who is
not according to their mind, they raise a loud
cry, and put him to death, or else so slander
him to men, who believe their every word,
that one finds no longer any love, any little
ray of confidence. Ah! how fortunate are
my brothers, the Dreams! they leap merrily
and lightly down upon the earth, care nothing
for those artful men, seek the slumbering, and
weave and paint for them, what makes happy
the heart, and brightens the eye with joy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy brothers are light-footed,&rdquo; said the
Queen, &ldquo;and thou, my darling, hast no reason
for envying them. Besides, I know these
border-watchmen well; men are not so wrong
in sending them out; there came so many
boastful fellows, who acted as if they had come
straight from my kingdom, and yet they had,
at best, only looked down upon us from some
mountain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why did they make me, thine own
daughter, suffer for this?&rdquo; wept forth M&auml;rchen.
&ldquo;Ah, if thou knewest how they have acted towards
me! They called me an old maid, and
threatened the next time not to admit me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, my daughter?&mdash;not to admit thee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span>
more?&rdquo; asked the Queen, as anger heightened
the color on her cheeks. &ldquo;But already I see
whence this comes; that wicked cousin has
slandered us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fashion? Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed M&auml;rchen;
&ldquo;she always used to act so friendly
towards us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know her, the false one!&rdquo; answered
the Queen. &ldquo;But try it again in spite of her,
my daughter: whoever wishes to do good,
must not rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother! suppose, then, they send me
back again, or slander me so that men let me
stay in a corner, disregarded, or alone and
slighted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the old, deluded by Fashion, value thee
at nothing, then turn thee to the young; truly
they are my little favorites. I send to them
my loveliest pictures through thy brothers, the
Dreams; yes, already I have often hovered
over them in person, caressed and kissed them,
and played fine games with them. They,
also, know me well, though not by name; for
I have often observed how in the night they
laugh at my stars, and in the morning, when
my shining fleeces play over the heavens, how
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg&nbsp;12]</a></span>
they clap their hands for joy. Moreover,
when they grow larger, they love me still;
then I help the charming maids to weave
variegated garlands, and the wild boys to become
still, while I seat myself near them, on
the lofty summit of a cliff, steep lofty cities and
brilliant palaces in the mist-world of the blue
mountains in the distance, and, on the red-tinged
clouds of evening, paint brave troops
of horsemen, and strange pilgrim processions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the dear children!&rdquo; exclaimed M&auml;rchen,
deeply affected. &ldquo;Yes&mdash;be it so! with
them I will make one more trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, my good child,&rdquo; answered the Queen;
&ldquo;go unto them; but I will attire thee in fine
style, that thou mayest please the little ones,
and that the old may not drive thee away.
See! the dress of an Almanach<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> will I give
thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Almanach, mother? Ah!&mdash;I will be
ashamed to parade, in such a way, before the
people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Queen gave the signal, and the attendants
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg&nbsp;13]</a></span>
brought in the rich dress of an Almanach.
It was inwrought with brilliant colors, and
beautiful figures. The waiting-maids plaited
the long hair of the fair girl, bound golden
sandals on her feet, and arrayed her in the
robe.</p>

<p>The modest M&auml;rchen dared not look up;
her mother, however, beheld her with satisfaction,
and clasped her in her arms. &ldquo;Go forth!&rdquo;
said she unto the little one; &ldquo;my blessing be
with thee. If they despise and scorn thee,
turn quickly unto me; perhaps later generations,
more true to nature, may again incline
to thee their hearts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus spoke Queen Phantasie, while M&auml;rchen
went down upon the earth. With beating
heart she approached the city, in which
the cunning watchmen dwelt: she dropped
her head towards the earth, wrapped her fine
robe closely around her, and with trembling
step drew near unto the gate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; exclaimed a deep, rough voice.
&ldquo;Look out, there! Here comes a new Almanach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen trembled as she heard this; many
old men, with gloomy countenances, rushed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg&nbsp;14]</a></span>
forth; they had sharp quills in their fists, and
held them towards M&auml;rchen. One of the
multitude strode up to her, and seized her
with rough hand by the chin. &ldquo;Just lift up
your head, Mr. Almanach,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that
one may see in your eyes whether you be
right or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Blushing, M&auml;rchen lifted her little head quite
up, and raised her dark eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&auml;rchen!&rdquo; exclaimed the watchmen, laughing
boisterously. &ldquo;M&auml;rchen! That we should
have had any doubt as to who was here! How
come you, now, by this dress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mother put it on me,&rdquo; answered M&auml;rchen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! she wishes to smuggle you past us!
Not this time! Out of the way; see that you
be gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the watchmen among
themselves, lifting up their sharp quills.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, I will go only to the children,&rdquo;
entreated M&auml;rchen; &ldquo;this, surely, you will
grant to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay there not, already, enough of these
menials in the land around?&rdquo; exclaimed one
of the watchmen. &ldquo;They only prattle nonsense
to our children.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg&nbsp;15]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let us see what she knows this time,&rdquo; said
another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; cried they, &ldquo;tell us what you
know; but make haste, for we have not much
time for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen stretched forth her hand, and described
with the forefinger, various figures in
the air. Thereupon they saw confused images
move slowly across it;&mdash;caravans, fine horses,
riders gayly attired, numerous tents upon the
sand of the desert; birds, and ships upon the
stormy seas; silent forests, and populous places,
and highways; battles, and peaceful wandering
tribes&mdash;all hovered, a motley crowd, in
animated pictures, over before them.</p>

<p>M&auml;rchen, in the eagerness with which she
had caused the figures to rise forth, had not
observed that the watchmen of the gate had
one by one fallen asleep. Just as she was
about to describe new lines, a friendly man
came up to her, and seized her hand. &ldquo;Look
here, good M&auml;rchen,&rdquo; said he, as he pointed to
the sleepers; &ldquo;for these thy varied creations
are as nothing; slip nimbly through the door;
they will not suspect that thou art in the land,
and thou canst quietly and unobserved pursue
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg&nbsp;16]</a></span>
thy way. I will lead thee unto my children;
in my house will give thee a peaceful, friendly
home; there thou mayest remain and live by
thyself; whenever my sons and daughters
shall have learned their lessons well, they shall
be permitted to run to thee with their plays,
and attend to thee. Dost thou agree?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how gladly will I follow thee unto
thy dear children! how diligently will I endeavor
to make, at times, for them, a happy
little hour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The good man nodded to her cordially, and
assisted her to step over the feet of the sleeping
men. M&auml;rchen, when she had got safely
across, looked around smilingly, and then
slipped quickly through the gate.</p>

<h2>THE CARAVAN.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcaposml"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>NCE upon a time, there marched
through the wilderness a
large Caravan. Upon the vast
plain, where one sees nothing
but sand and heaven, were
heard already, in the far distance, the little bells
of the camels, and the silver-toned ones of the
horses; a thick cloud of dust, which preceded
them, announced their approach, and when a
gale of wind separated the clouds, glittering
weapons and brilliant dresses dazzled the eye.
Such was the appearance of the Caravan to a
man who was riding up towards it in an oblique
direction. He was mounted on a fine Arabian
courser, covered with a tiger-skin; silver bells
were suspended from the deep-red stripe work,
and on the head of the horse waved a plume
of heron feathers. The rider was of majestic
mien, and his attire corresponded with the
splendor of his horse: a white turban, richly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg&nbsp;18]</a></span>
inwrought with gold, adorned his head, his
habit and wide pantaloons were of bright red,
and a curved sword with a magnificent handle
hung by his side. He had arranged the turban
far down upon his forehead; this, together
with the dark eyes which gleamed forth from
under his bushy brows, and the long beard
which hung down under his arched nose, gave
him a wild, daring expression. When the
horseman had advanced fifty paces farther, the
foremost line of the Caravan was near, and
putting spurs to his steed, in the twinkling of
an eye he was at the head of the procession.
It was so unusual a thing to see a solitary rider
travelling through the desert, that the guard, apprehending
an attack, put their lances in rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What mean you?&rdquo; exclaimed the horseman,
as he saw himself received in so hostile
a manner. &ldquo;Do you imagine that a single
man would attack your Caravan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ashamed of their precipitation, the guards
lowered their lances, and their leader rode
forth to the stranger, and asked to know his
pleasure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is the lord of this Caravan?&rdquo; inquired
the cavalier.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg&nbsp;19]</a></span>
&ldquo;It belongs to no single lord,&rdquo; answered the
interrogated one; &ldquo;but to several merchants,
who march from Mecca to their native country,
and whom we escort through the desert;
for oftentimes scoundrels of every kind alarm
those who travel here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then lead me to the merchants,&rdquo; responded
the stranger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That cannot be now,&rdquo; rejoined the other,
&ldquo;for we must proceed without delay, and the
merchants are at least a quarter of a mile behind;
if, however, you would like to ride along
with me until we halt to take our siesta, I will
execute your desire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger said nothing further; he drew
forth a long pipe which he had attached to his
saddle, and began to smoke with slow puffs, as
he rode along by the leader of the van. The
latter knew not what to make of the stranger,
and ventured not to ask his name in so many
words; but when he artfully endeavored to
weave up a conversation, the cavalier, to his
remarks, &ldquo;You smoke there a good tobacco,&rdquo;
or, &ldquo;Your horse has a brave gait,&rdquo; constantly
replied with only a brief &ldquo;Yes, yes!&rdquo; At last
they arrived at the place where they were to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg&nbsp;20]</a></span>
halt for the siesta: the chief sent his people
forward to keep a look-out, while he remained
with the stranger to receive the Caravan.
First, thirty camels passed by, heavily laden,
guided by armed drivers. After these, on fine
horses, came the five merchants to whom the
Caravan belonged. They were, for the most
part, men of advanced age, of grave and serious
aspect; one, however, seemed much
younger, as well as more gay and lively than
the rest. A large number of camels and pack-horses
closed the procession.</p>

<p>Tents were pitched, and the camels and
horses fastened around. In the midst was a
large pavilion of blue silk, to which the chief
of the escort conducted the stranger. When
they reached the entrance, they saw the five
merchants seated on gold-embroidered cushions;
black slaves were carrying around to
them food and drink. &ldquo;Whom bringest thou
hither to us?&rdquo; exclaimed the young merchant
unto the leader: before, however, the latter
could reply, the stranger spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am called Selim Baruch, and am from
Bagdad; I was taken captive by a robber-horde
on a ride to Mecca, but three days ago
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg&nbsp;21]</a></span>
managed to free myself from confinement.
The mighty Prophet permitted me to hear, in
the far distance, the little bells of your Caravan,
and so I came to you. Allow me to ride
in your company; you will grant your protection
to no unworthy person; and when we
reach Bagdad, I will reward your kindness
richly, for I am the nephew of the Grand Vizier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The oldest of the merchants took up the
discourse: &ldquo;Selim Baruch,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;welcome
to our protection! It affords us joy to be of
assistance to thee. But first of all, sit down,
and eat and drink with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selim Baruch seated himself among the
merchants, and ate and drank with them.
After the meal, the slaves removed the table,
and brought long pipes and Turkish sherbet.
The merchants sat for some time in silence,
while they puffed out before them the bluish,
smoke-clouds, watching how they formed circle
after circle, and at last were dissipated in
the ambient air. The young merchant finally
broke the silence. &ldquo;Here sit we for three
days,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;on horseback, and at table,
without doing any thing to while away the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg&nbsp;22]</a></span>
time. I feel this tediousness much, for I am accustomed
after dinner to see dancers, or to hear
singing and music. Know you nothing, my
friends, that will pass away the time for us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four elder merchants smoked away,
and seemed to be seriously reflecting, but the
stranger spoke: &ldquo;If it be allowed me, I will
make a proposition to you. I think one of us,
at this resting-place, could relate something for
the amusement of the rest: this, certainly,
would serve to pass the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Selim Baruch, thou hast well spoken,&rdquo; said
Achmet, the oldest of the merchants; &ldquo;let us
accept the proposal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am rejoiced that it pleases you,&rdquo; answered
Selim; &ldquo;and, in order that you may see
that I desire nothing unreasonable, I will myself
begin.&rdquo; The five merchants, overjoyed,
drew nearer together, and placed the stranger
in their midst. The slaves replenished their
cups, filled the pipes of their masters afresh,
and brought glowing coals for a light. Selim
cleared his voice with a hearty draught of
sherbet, smoothed back the long beard from
his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Listen then to <span class="smcap">the History
of Caliph Stork</span>.&rdquo;</p>

alt="THE HISTORY OF CALIPH STORK, CHAPTER I." />
</div>


<p><span class="dropcapolrg"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>NCE upon a time, on a fine
afternoon, the Caliph Chasid
was seated on his sofa
in Bagdad: he had slept a
little, (for it was a hot day,)
and now, after his nap,
looked quite happy. He
smoked a long pipe of rosewood,
sipped, now and then, a
little coffee which a slave poured
out for him, and stroked his
beard, well-satisfied, for the flavor
pleased him. In a word, it was
evident that the Caliph was in a
good humor. At this season one could easily
speak with him, for he was always very mild
and affable; on which account did his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg&nbsp;24]</a></span>
Grand-Vizier, Mansor, seek him at this hour, every
day.</p>

<p>On the afternoon in question he also came,
but looked very serious, quite contrary to his
usual custom. The Caliph removed the pipe,
a moment, from his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Wherefore,
Grand-Vizier, wearest thou so thoughtful
a visage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Grand-Vizier folded his arms crosswise
over his breast, made reverence to his lord,
and answered: &ldquo;Sir, whether I wear a
thoughtful look, I know not, but there, below
the palace, stands a trader who has such fine
goods, that it vexes me not to have abundant
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Caliph, who had often before this gladly
indulged his Vizier, sent down his black slave
to bring up the merchant, and in a moment
they entered together. He was a short, fat
man, of swarthy countenance and tattered
dress. He carried a chest in which were
all kinds of wares&mdash;pearls and rings, richly-wrought
pistols, goblets, and combs. The
Caliph and his Vizier examined them all, and
the former at length purchased fine pistols for
himself and Mansor, and a comb for the Vizier&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span>
wife. When the pedler was about to close
his chest, the Caliph espied a little drawer, and
inquired whether there were wares in that
also. The trader drew forth the drawer, and
pointed out therein a box of black powder, and
a paper with strange characters, which neither
the Caliph nor Mansor could read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I obtained these two articles, some time
ago, from a merchant, who found them in the
street at Mecca,&rdquo; said the trader. &ldquo;I know
not what they contain. They are at your service
for a moderate price; I can do nothing
with them.&rdquo; The Caliph, who gladly kept old
manuscripts in his library, though he could
not read them, purchased writing and box, and
discharged the merchant. The Caliph, however,
thought he would like to know what the
writing contained, and asked the Vizier if he
knew any one who could decipher it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most worthy lord and master,&rdquo; answered
he, &ldquo;near the great Mosque lives a man called
&lsquo;Selim the Learned,&rsquo; who understands all
languages: let him come, perhaps he is acquainted
with these mysterious characters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The learned Selim was soon brought in.
&ldquo;Selim,&rdquo; said the Caliph to him, &ldquo;Selim, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg&nbsp;26]</a></span>
say thou art very wise; look a moment at
this manuscript, and see if thou canst read
it. If thou canst, thou shalt receive from me a
new festival-garment; if not, thou shalt have
twelve blows on the cheek, and five and twenty
on the soles of the feet, since, in that case,
thou art unjustly called Selim the Learned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Selim bowed himself and said, &ldquo;Sire, thy
will be done!&rdquo; For a long time he pored over
the manuscript, but suddenly exclaimed, &ldquo;This
is Latin, sire, or I will suffer myself to be
hung.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is Latin, tell us what is therein,&rdquo;
commanded the Caliph. Selim began to translate:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man, whosoever thou mayest be that
findest this, praise Allah for his goodness!
Whoever snuffs of the dust of this powder,
and at the same time says, <span class="smcap">Mutabor</span>, can
change himself into any animal, and shall also
understand its language. If he wishes to return
to the form of a man, then let him bow
three times to the East, and repeat the same
word. But take thou care, if thou be
transformed, that thou laugh not; otherwise
shall the magic word fade altogether from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg&nbsp;27]</a></span>
thy remembrance, and thou shalt remain a
beast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Selim the Learned had thus read,
the Caliph was overjoyed. He made the
translator swear to tell no one of their secret,
presented him a beautiful garment, and discharged
him. To his Grand-Vizier, however,
he said: &ldquo;That I call a good purchase,
Mansor! How can I contain myself until I
become an animal! Early in the morning,
do thou come to me. Then will we go together
into the country, take a little snuff out
of my box, and hear what is said in the air
and in the water, in the forest and in the
field.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapssml"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>CARCELY, on the next morning,
had the Caliph Chasid
breakfasted and dressed himself,
when the Grand-Vizier
appeared, to accompany him,
as he had commanded, on his
walk. The Caliph placed the box with the
magic powder in his girdle, and having commanded
his train to remain behind, set out,
all alone with Mansor, upon their expedition.
They went at first through the extensive gardens
of the Caliph, but looked around in vain
for some living thing, in order to make their
strange experiment. The Vizier finally proposed
to go farther on, to a pond, where he
had often before seen many storks, which, by
their grave behavior and clattering, had always
excited his attention. The Caliph approved
of the proposition of his Vizier, and
went with him to the pond. When they
reached it they saw a stork walking gravely to
and fro, seeking for frogs, and now and then
clattering at something before her. Presently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg&nbsp;29]</a></span>
they saw, too, another stork hovering far up
in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will wager my beard, most worthy sire,&rdquo;
exclaimed the Grand-Vizier, &ldquo;that these two
long-feet are even now carrying on a fine conversation
with one another. How would it
be, if we should become storks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well spoken!&rdquo; answered the Caliph. &ldquo;But
first, we will consider how we may become
men again.&mdash;Right! Three times bow to the
East, and exclaim &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Mutabor</span>!&rsquo; then will I be
Caliph once more, and thou Vizier. Only,
for the sake of Heaven, laugh not, or we are
lost!&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the Caliph was thus speaking, he saw
the other stork hovering over their heads, and
sinking slowly to the ground. He drew the box
quickly out of his girdle, and took a good
pinch; then he presented it to the Grand-Vizier,
who also snuffed some of the powder,
and both exclaimed &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mutabor</span>!&rdquo; Immediately
their legs shrivelled away and became slender
and red; the handsome yellow slippers of
the Caliph and his companion became misshapen
stork&rsquo;s feet; their arms turned to wings;
the neck extended up from the shoulders, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg&nbsp;30]</a></span>
was an ell long; their beards had vanished,
and their whole bodies were covered with soft
feathers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a beautiful beak, my lord Grand-Vizier,&rdquo;
exclaimed the Caliph after long astonishment.
&ldquo;By the beard of the Prophet, in my
whole life I have not seen any thing like it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most humble thanks!&rdquo; responded the Vizier,
as he bowed. &ldquo;But if I dared venture it, I
might assert that your Highness looks almost
as handsome when a stork, as when a Caliph.
But suppose, if it be pleasing to you, that we
observe and listen to our comrades, to see, if
we actually understand Storkish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other stork reached the
earth. He cleaned his feet with his bill,
smoothed his feathers, and moved towards the
first. Both the new birds, thereupon, made
haste to draw near, and to their astonishment,
heard the following conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Madam Long-legs; already,
so early, upon the pond?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine thanks, beloved Clatter-beak. I have
brought me a little breakfast. Would you
like, perhaps, the quarter of an eider-duck, or
a little frog&rsquo;s thigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg&nbsp;31]</a></span>
&ldquo;My best thanks, but this morning I have
little appetite. I come to the pond for a very
different reason. I have to dance to-day before
the guests of my father, and I wish to
practise a little in private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Immediately, thereupon, the young lady-stork
stepped, in great excitement, over the
plain. The Caliph and Mansor looked on her
in amazement. When, however, she stood in
a picturesque attitude upon one foot, and, at
the same time, gracefully moved her wings
like a fan, the two could contain themselves no
longer; a loud laugh broke forth from their
bills. The Caliph was the first to recover
himself. &ldquo;That were once a joke,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;which gold could not have purchased. Pity!
that the stupid birds should have been driven
away by our laughter; otherwise they would
certainly even yet have been singing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But already it occurred to the Grand-Vizier
that, during their metamorphosis, laughter was
prohibited; he shared his anxiety on this head
with the Caliph. &ldquo;By Mecca and Medina!
that were a sorry jest, if I am to remain a
stork. Bethink thyself, then, of the foolish
word, for I can recall it not.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg&nbsp;32]</a></span>
&ldquo;Three times must we bow ourselves to the
East, and at the same time say, Mu&mdash;mu&mdash;mu&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They turned to the East, and bowed so low
that their beaks almost touched the earth.
But, O misery! that magic word had escaped
them; and though the Caliph prostrated himself
again and again, though at the same time
the Vizier earnestly cried &ldquo;Mu&mdash;mu&mdash;,&rdquo; all
recollection thereof had vanished, and poor
Chasid and his Vizier were to remain storks.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg&nbsp;33]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcaptsml"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE enchanted ones wandered
sorrowfully through the fields,
not knowing, in their calamity,
what they should first set
about. To the city they could not return, for
the purpose of discovering themselves, for who
would have believed a stork that he was the
Caliph? or, if he should find credit, would the
inhabitants of Bagdad have been willing to
have such a bird for their master? Thus, for
several days, did they wander around, supporting
themselves on the produce of the fields,
which, however, on account of their long bills,
they could not readily pick up. For eider-ducks
and frogs they had no appetite, for they
feared with such dainty morsels to ruin their
stomachs. In this pitiable situation their only
consolation was that they could fly, and accordingly
they often winged their way to the
roofs of Bagdad, to see what was going on
therein.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg&nbsp;34]</a></span>
On the first day they observed great commotion
and mourning in the streets; but on
the fourth after their transformation, they lighted
by chance upon the royal palace, from
which they saw, in the street beneath, a splendid
procession. Drums and fifes sounded; on
a richly-caparisoned steed was seated a man,
in a scarlet mantle embroidered with gold, surrounded
by gorgeously-attired attendants. Half
Bagdad was running after him, crying, &ldquo;Hail,
Mizra! Lord of Bagdad!&rdquo; All this the two
storks beheld from the roof of the palace, and
the Caliph Chasid exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perceivest thou now why I am enchanted,
Grand-Vizier? This Mizra is the son of my
deadly enemy, the mighty sorcerer Kaschnur,
who, in an evil hour, vowed revenge against
me. Still I do not abandon all hope. Come
with me, thou faithful companion of my misery;
we will go to the grave of the Prophet;
perhaps in that holy spot the charm may be
dissolved.&rdquo; They raised themselves from the
roof of the palace, and flew in the direction of
Medina.</p>

<p>In the use of their wings, however, they
experienced some difficulty, for the two storks
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span>
had, as yet, but little practice. &ldquo;O Sire!&rdquo;
groaned out the Vizier, after a couple of hours;
&ldquo;with your permission, I can hold out no longer;
you fly so rapidly! Besides, it is already
evening, and we would do well to seek a shelter
for the night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chasid gave ear to the request of his attendant,
and thereupon saw, in the vale beneath, a
ruin which appeared to promise safe lodgings;
and thither, accordingly, they flew. The place
where they had alighted for the night, seemed
formerly to have been a castle. Gorgeous
columns projected from under the rubbish, and
several chambers, which were still in a state
of tolerable preservation, testified to the former
magnificence of the mansion. Chasid and his
companion went around through the corridor,
to seek for themselves a dry resting-place;
suddenly the stork Mansor paused. &ldquo;Lord
and master,&rdquo; he whispered softly, &ldquo;were it not
foolish for a Grand-Vizier, still more for a stork,
to be alarmed at spectres, my mind is very
uncomfortable; for here, close at hand, sighs
and groans are very plainly perceptible.&rdquo; The
Caliph now in turn stood still, and quite distinctly
heard a low moaning, which seemed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg&nbsp;36]</a></span>
belong rather to a human being than a beast.
Full of expectation, he essayed to proceed to
the place whence the plaintive sounds issued:
but the Vizier, seizing him by the wing with
his beak, entreated him fervently not to plunge
them in new and unknown dangers. In vain!
the Caliph, to whom a valiant heart beat beneath
his stork-wing, burst away with the loss
of a feather, and hastened into a gloomy gallery.
In a moment he reached a door, which
seemed only on the latch, and out of which he
heard distinct sighs, accompanied by a low
moaning. He pushed the door open with his
bill, but stood, chained by amazement, upon
the threshold. In the ruinous apartment, which
was now but dimly lighted through a grated
window, he saw a huge screech-owl sitting on
the floor. Big tears rolled down from her
large round eyes, and with ardent voice she
sent her cries forth from her crooked bill. As
soon, however, as she espied the Caliph and
his Vizier, who meanwhile had crept softly up
behind, she raised a loud cry of joy. She
neatly wiped away the tears with her brown-striped
wing, and to the great astonishment of
both, exclaimed, in good human Arabic,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg&nbsp;37]</a></span>
&ldquo;Welcome to you, storks! you are to me a
good omen of deliverance, for it was once
prophesied to me that, through storks, a great
piece of good fortune is to fall to my lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the Caliph recovered from his amazement,
he bowed his long neck, brought his
slender feet into an elegant position, and said:
&ldquo;Screech-owl, after your words, I venture to
believe that I see in you a companion in misfortune.
But, alas! this hope that through us
thy deliverance will take place, is groundless.
Thou wilt, thyself, realize our helplessness,
when thou hearest our history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Screech-owl entreated him to impart it
to her, and the Caliph, raising himself up, related
what we already know.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg&nbsp;38]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapwsml"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>HEN the Caliph had told his
history to the owl, she thanked
him, and said: &ldquo;Listen to my
story, also, and hear how I am
no less unfortunate than thyself.
My father is the king of India; I, his
only, unfortunate daughter, am called Lusa.
That same sorcerer Kaschnur, who transformed
you, has plunged me also in this affliction.
He came, one day, to my father, and asked
me in marriage for his son Mizra. My father,
however, who is a passionate man, cast him
down the steps. The wretch managed to
creep up to me again under another form, and
as I was on one occasion taking the fresh air
in my garden, clad as a slave, he presented
me a potion which changed me into this detestable
figure. He brought me hither, swooning
through fear, and exclaimed in my ear
with awful voice, &lsquo;There shalt thou remain,
frightful one, despised even by beasts, until thy
death, or till one, of his own free will, even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg&nbsp;39]</a></span>
under this execrable form, take thee to wife.
Thus revenge I myself upon thee, and thy
haughty father!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since then, many months have elapsed;
alone and mournfully I live, like a hermit, in
these walls, abhorred by the world, an abomination
even to brutes. Beautiful nature is
shut out from me; for I am blind by day, and
only when the moon sheds her wan light upon
this ruin, falls the shrouding veil from mine
eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl ended, and again wiped her eyes
with her wing, for the narration of her wo had
called forth tears. The Caliph was plunged
in deep meditation by the story of the Princess.
&ldquo;If I am not altogether deceived,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you will find that between our misfortunes
a secret connection exists; but where
can I find the key to this enigma?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl answered him, &ldquo;My lord! this also
is plain to me; for once, in early youth, it was
foretold to me by a wise woman, that a stork
would bring me great happiness, and perhaps
I might know how we may save ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Caliph was much astonished, and inquired
in what way she meant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg&nbsp;40]</a></span>
&ldquo;The enchanter who has made us both
miserable,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;comes once every
month to these ruins. Not far from this
chamber is a hall; there, with many confederates,
he is wont to banquet. Already
I have often watched them: they relate to one
another their shameful deeds&mdash;perhaps he
might then mention the magic word which
you have forgotten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dearest Princess!&rdquo; exclaimed the Caliph:
&ldquo;tell us&mdash;when will he come, and where
is the hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The owl was silent a moment, and then
said: &ldquo;Take it not unkindly, but only on one
condition can I grant your wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Speak out! speak out!&rdquo; cried Chasid.
&ldquo;Command; whatever it may be, I am ready
to obey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is this: I would fain at the same time
be free; this, however, can only take place, if
one of you offer me his hand.&rdquo; At this proposition
the storks seemed somewhat surprised,
and the Caliph beckoned to his attendant to
step aside with him a moment. &ldquo;Grand-Vizier,&rdquo;
said the Caliph before the door, &ldquo;this
is a stupid affair, but you can set it all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg&nbsp;41]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thus?&rdquo; rejoined he; &ldquo;that my wife, when
I go home, may scratch my eyes out? Besides,
I am an old man, while you are still
young and unmarried, and can better give
your hand to a young and beautiful princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! that is the point,&rdquo; sighed the Caliph,
as he mournfully drooped his wings: &ldquo;who
told you she is young and fair? That is
equivalent to buying a cat in a sack!&rdquo; They
continued to converse together for a long time,
but finally, when the Caliph saw that Mansor
would rather remain a stork than marry the
owl, he determined sooner, himself, to accept
the condition. The owl was overjoyed; she
avowed to them that they could have come at
no better time, since, probably, that very night,
the sorcerers would assemble together.</p>

<p>She left the apartment with the storks, in
order to lead them to the saloon; they went a
long way through a gloomy passage, until at
last a very bright light streamed upon them
through a half-decayed wall. When they
reached this place, the owl advised them to
halt very quietly. From the breach, near
which they were standing, they could look
down upon a large saloon, adorned all around
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg&nbsp;42]</a></span>
with pillars, and splendidly decorated, in which
many colored lamps restored the light of day.
In the midst of the saloon stood a round table,
laden with various choice meats. Around the
table extended a sofa, on which eight men
were seated. In one of these men the storks
recognised the very merchant, who had sold
them the magic powder. His neighbor desired
him to tell them his latest exploits; whereupon
he related, among others, the story of the Caliph
and his Vizier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you give them for a word?&rdquo; inquired
of him one of the other magicians.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A right ponderous Latin one&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mutabor</span>.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg&nbsp;43]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V.</h3>


<p><span class="dropcapwsml2"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>HEN the storks heard this
through their chasm in the
wall, they became almost beside
themselves with joy. They
ran so quickly with their long
feet to the door of the ruin, that the owl
could scarcely keep up with them. Thereupon
spoke the Caliph to her: &ldquo;Preserver of
my life and that of my friend, in token of our
eternal thanks for what thou hast done for us,
take me as thy husband.&rdquo; Then he turned to
the East: three times they bowed their long
necks towards the sun, which was even now
rising above the mountains, and at the same
moment exclaimed &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Mutabor</span>!&rdquo; In a twinkling
they were restored, and in the excessive
joy of their newly-bestowed life, alternately
laughing and weeping, were folded in each
other&rsquo;s arms. But who can describe their
astonishment when they looked around? A
beautiful woman, attired as a queen, stood
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg&nbsp;44]</a></span>
before them. Smiling, she gave the Caliph
her hand, and said, &ldquo;Know you your screech-owl
no longer?&rdquo; It was she; the Caliph was
in such transports at her beauty and pleasantness,
as to cry out, that it was the most fortunate
moment in his life, when he became a
stork.</p>

<p>The three now proceeded together to Bagdad.
The Caliph found in his dress, not only
the box of magic powder, but also his money-bag.
By means thereof, he purchased at the
nearest village what was necessary for their
journey, and accordingly they soon appeared
before the gates of the city. Here, however,
the arrival of the Caliph excited great astonishment.
They had given out that he
was dead, and the people were therefore
highly rejoiced to have again their beloved
lord.</p>

<p>So much the more, however, burned their
hatred against the impostor Mizra. They
proceeded to the palace, and caught the old
magician and his son. The old man the Caliph
sent to the same chamber in the ruin,
which the princess, as a screech-owl, had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg&nbsp;45]</a></span>
inhabited, and there had him hung; unto the
son, however, who understood nothing of his
father&rsquo;s arts, he gave his choice,&mdash;to die, or
snuff some of the powder. Having chosen
the latter, the Grand-Vizier presented him the
box. A hearty pinch, and the magic word of
the Caliph converted him into a stork. Chasid
had him locked up in an iron cage, and hung
in his garden.</p>

<p>Long and happily lived Caliph Chasid with
his spouse, the Princess; his pleasantest hours
were always those, when in the afternoon the
Vizier sought him; and whenever the Caliph
was in a very good humor, he would let himself
down so far, as to show Mansor how he
looked, when a stork. He would gravely
march along, with rigid feet, up and down the
chamber, make a clattering noise, wave his
arms like wings, and show how, in vain, he
had prostrated himself to the East, and cried out,
<span class="smcap">Mu&mdash;mu</span>. To the Princess and her children,
this imitation always afforded great amusement:
when, however, the Caliph clattered,
and bowed, and cried out, too long, then the
Vizier would threaten him that he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg&nbsp;46]</a></span>
disclose to his spouse what had been proposed
outside the door of the Princess Screech-owl!</p>

<p>When Selim Baruch had finished his story,
the merchants declared themselves delighted
therewith. &ldquo;Verily, the afternoon has passed
away from us without our having observed
it!&rdquo; exclaimed one of them, throwing back the
covering of the tent: &ldquo;the evening wind
blows cool, we can still make a good distance
on our journey.&rdquo; To this his companions
agreed; the tents were struck, and the Caravan
proceeded on its way in the same order in
which it had come up.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg&nbsp;47]</a></span>
They rode almost all the night long, for it
was refreshing and starry, whereas the day
was sultry. At last they arrived at a convenient
stopping-place; here they pitched their
tents, and composed themselves to rest. To
the stranger the merchants attended, as a most
valued guest. One gave him cushions, a second
covering, a third slaves; in a word, he
was as well provided for as if he had been at
home. The hottest hours of the day had already
arrived, when they awoke again, and
they unanimously determined to wait for evening
in this place. After they had eaten together,
they moved more closely to each
other, and the young merchant, turning to the
oldest, addressed him: &ldquo;Selim Baruch yesterday
made a pleasant afternoon for us; suppose
Achmet, that you also tell us something, be it
either from your long life, which has known so
many adventures, or even a pretty M&auml;rchen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon these words Achmet was silent some
time, as if he were in doubt whether to tell
this or that; at last he began to speak: &ldquo;Dear
friends, on this our journey you have proved
yourselves faithful companions, and Selim also
deserves my confidence; I will therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg&nbsp;48]</a></span>
impart to you something of my life, of which,
under other circumstances, I would speak reluctantly,
and, indeed, not to any one: <span class="smcap">The
History of the Spectre Ship</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE HISTORY
OF
THE SPECTRE SHIP.</h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

alt="Two people in a rowing boat signal a ship in the distance" />
</div>


<p><span class="dropcapmlrg"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>Y father had a little shop
in Balsora; he was neither
rich, nor poor, but one of
those who do not like to
risk any thing, through fear
of losing the little that they
have. He brought me up
plainly, but virtuously, and soon
I advanced so far, that I was able
to make valuable suggestions to
him in his business. When I
reached my eighteenth year, in
the midst of his first speculation of
any importance, he died; probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg&nbsp;50]</a></span>
through anxiety at having intrusted a thousand
gold pieces to the sea. I was obliged,
soon after, to deem him happy in his fortunate
death, for in a few weeks the intelligence
reached us, that the vessel, to which my
father had committed his goods, had been
wrecked. This misfortune, however, could
not depress my youthful spirits. I converted
all that my father had left into money, and set
out to try my fortune in foreign lands, accompanied
only by an old servant of the family,
who, on account of ancient attachment, would
not part from me and my destiny.</p>

<p>In the harbor of Balsora we embarked, with
a favorable wind. The ship, in which I had
taken passage, was bound to India. We had
now for fifteen days sailed in the usual track,
when the Captain predicted to us a storm. He
wore a thoughtful look, for it seemed he knew
that, in this place, there was not sufficient
depth of water to encounter a storm with
safety. He ordered them to take in all sail,
and we moved along quite slowly. The night
set in clear and cold, and the Captain began to
think that he had been mistaken in his forebodings.
All at once there floated close by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg&nbsp;51]</a></span>
ours, a ship which none of us had observed
before. A wild shout and cry ascended from
the deck, at which, occurring at this anxious
season, before a storm, I wondered not a little.
But the Captain by my side was deadly pale:
&ldquo;My ship is lost,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;there sails
Death!&rdquo; Before I could demand an explanation
of these singular words, the sailors rushed
in, weeping and wailing. &ldquo;Have you seen
it?&rdquo; they exclaimed: &ldquo;all is now over with
us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Captain had words of consolation
read to them out of the Koran, and seated
himself at the helm. But in vain! The tempest
began visibly to rise with a roaring noise,
and, before an hour passed by, the ship struck
and remained aground. The boats were lowered,
and scarcely had the last sailors saved
themselves, when the vessel went down before
our eyes, and I was launched, a beggar, upon
the sea. But our misfortune had still no end.
Frightfully roared the tempest, the boat could
no longer be governed. I fastened myself
firmly to my old servant, and we mutually
promised not to be separated from each other.
At last the day broke, but, with the first glance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg&nbsp;52]</a></span>
of the morning-red, the wind struck and upset
the boat in which we were seated. After that
I saw my shipmates no more. The shock deprived
me of consciousness, and when I returned
to my senses, I found myself in the
arms of my old faithful attendant, who had
saved himself on the boat which had been upturned,
and had come in search of me. The
storm had abated; of our vessel there was
nothing any more to be seen, but we plainly
descried, at no great distance from us, another
ship, towards which the waves were driving
us. As we approached, I recognised the vessel
as the same which had passed by us in the
night, and which had thrown the Captain into
such consternation. I felt a strange horror of
this ship; the intimation of the Captain, which
had been so fearfully corroborated, the desolate
appearance of the ship, on which, although
as we drew near we uttered loud cries, no one
was visible, alarmed me. Nevertheless this
was our only expedient; accordingly, we praised
the Prophet, who had so miraculously preserved
us.</p>

<p>From the fore-part of the ship hung down a
long cable; for the purpose of laying hold of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg&nbsp;53]</a></span>
this, we paddled with our hands and feet. At
last we were successful. Loudly I raised my
voice, but all remained quiet as ever, on board
the vessel. Then we climbed up by the rope, I,
as the youngest, taking the lead. But horror!
what a spectacle was there presented to my
eye, as I stepped upon the deck! The floor
was red with blood; upon it lay twenty or
thirty corpses in Turkish costume; by the
middle-mast stood a man richly attired, with
sabre in hand&mdash;but his face was wan and distorted;
through his forehead passed a large
spike which fastened him to the mast&mdash;he was
dead! Terror chained my feet; I dared hardly
to breathe. At last my companion stood
by my side; he, too, was overpowered at sight
of the deck which exhibited no living thing,
but only so many frightful corpses. After
having, in the anguish of our souls, supplicated
the Prophet, we ventured to move forward.
At every step we looked around to see if something
new, something still more horrible, would
not present itself. But all remained as it was&mdash;far
and wide, no living thing but ourselves,
and the ocean-world. Not once did we dare
to speak aloud, through fear that the dead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg&nbsp;54]</a></span>
Captain there nailed to the mast would bend
his rigid eyes upon us, or lest one of the corpses
should turn his head. At last we arrived
at a staircase, which led into the hold. There
involuntarily we came to a halt, and looked
at each other, for neither of us exactly ventured
to express his thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said my faithful servant, &ldquo;something
awful has happened here. Nevertheless,
even if the ship down there below is full of
murderers, still would I rather submit myself
to their mercy or cruelty, than spend a longer
time among these dead bodies.&rdquo; I agreed
with him, and so we took heart, and descended,
full of apprehension. But the stillness of death
prevailed here also, and there was no sound
save that of our steps upon the stairs. We
stood before the door of the cabin; I applied
my ear, and listened&mdash;there was nothing to be
heard. I opened it. The room presented a
confused appearance; clothes, weapons, and
other articles, lay disordered together. The
crew, or at least the Captain, must shortly before
have been carousing, for the remains of a
banquet lay scattered around. We went on
from room to room, from chamber to chamber
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span>
finding, in all, royal stores of silk, pearls, and
other costly articles. I was beside myself with
joy at the sight, for as there was no one on
the ship, I thought I could appropriate all to
myself; but Ibrahim thereupon called to my
notice that we were still far from land, at
which we could not arrive, alone and without
human help.</p>

<p>We refreshed ourselves with the meats and
drink, which we found in rich profusion, and
at last ascended upon deck. But here again
we shivered at the awful sight of the bodies.
We determined to free ourselves therefrom,
by throwing them overboard; but how were
we startled to find, that no one could move
them from their places! So firmly were they
fastened to the floor, that to remove them one
would have had to take up the planks of the
deck, for which tools were wanting to us.
The Captain, moreover, could not be loosened
from the mast, nor could we even wrest the
sabre from his rigid hand. We passed the
day in sorrowful reflection on our condition;
and, when night began to draw near, I gave
permission to the old Ibrahim to lie down to
sleep, while I would watch upon the deck, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg&nbsp;56]</a></span>
look out for means of deliverance. When,
however, the moon shone forth, and by the
stars I calculated that it was about the eleventh
hour, sleep so irresistibly overpowered
me that I fell back, involuntarily, behind a
cask which stood upon the deck. It was rather
lethargy than sleep, for I plainly heard the
sea beat against the side of the vessel, and the
sails creak and whistle in the wind. All at
once I thought I heard voices, and the steps
of men upon the deck. I wished to arise and
see what it was, but a strange power fettered
my limbs, and I could not once open my eyes.
But still more distinct became the voices; it
appeared to me as if a merry crew were moving
around upon the deck. In the midst of
this I thought I distinguished the powerful
voice of a commander, followed by the noise
of ropes and sails. Gradually my senses left
me; I fell into a deep slumber, in which I still
seemed to hear the din of weapons, and awoke
only when the sun was high in the heavens,
and sent down his burning rays upon my face.
Full of wonder, I gazed about me; storm, ship,
the bodies, and all that I had heard in the
night, recurred to me as a dream; but when I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg&nbsp;57]</a></span>
looked around, I found all as it had been the
day before. Immoveable lay the bodies, immoveably
was the Captain fastened to the
mast; I laughed at my dream, and proceeded
in search of my old companion.</p>

<p>The latter was seated in sorrowful meditation
in the cabin. &ldquo;O master,&rdquo; he exclaimed
as I entered, &ldquo;rather would I lie in the deepest
bottom of the sea, than pass another night
in this enchanted ship.&rdquo; I asked him the reason
of his grief, and thus he answered me:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I had slept an hour, I awoke, and
heard the noise of walking to and fro over my
head. I thought at first that it was you, but
there were at least twenty running around; I
also heard conversation and cries. At length
came heavy steps upon the stairs. After this
I was no longer conscious; but at times my
recollection returned for a moment, and then
I saw the same man who is nailed to the mast,
sit down at that table, singing and drinking;
and he who lies not far from him on the floor,
in a scarlet cloak, sat near him, and helped
him to drink.&rdquo; Thus spoke my old servant
to me.</p>

<p>You may believe me, my friends, that all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg&nbsp;58]</a></span>
was not right to my mind; for there was no
delusion&mdash;I too had plainly heard the dead.
To sail in such company was to me horrible;
my Ibrahim, however, was again absorbed in
deep reflection. &ldquo;I have it now!&rdquo; he exclaimed
at length; there occurred to him,
namely, a little verse, which his grandfather,
a man of experience and travel, had taught
him, and which could give assistance against
every ghost and spectre. He also maintained
that we could, the next night, prevent the unnatural
sleep which had come upon us, by repeating
right fervently sentences out of the
Koran.</p>

<p>The proposition of the old man pleased me
well. In anxious expectation we saw the
night set in. Near the cabin was a little room,
to which we determined to retire. We bored
several holes in the door, large enough to give
us a view of the whole cabin; then we shut it
as firmly as we could from within, and Ibrahim
wrote the name of the Prophet in all four corners
of the room. Thus we awaited the terrors
of the night.</p>

<p>It might again have been about the eleventh
hour, when a strong inclination for sleep began
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg&nbsp;59]</a></span>
to overpower me. My companion, thereupon,
advised me to repeat some sentences from the
Koran, which assisted me to retain my consciousness.
All at once it seemed to become
lively overhead; the ropes creaked, there were
steps upon the deck, and several voices were
plainly distinguishable. We remained, a few
moments, in intense anxiety; then we heard
something descending the cabin stairs. When
the old man became aware of this, he began
to repeat the words which his grandfather had
taught him to use against spirits and witchcraft:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;Come you, from the air descending,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Rise you from the deep sea-cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Spring you forth where flames are blending,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Glide you in the dismal grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Allah reigns, let all adore him!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Own him, spirits&mdash;bow before him!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>I must confess I did not put much faith in
this verse, and my hair stood on end when
the door flew open. The same large, stately
man entered, whom I had seen nailed to the
mast. The spike still passed through the middle
of his brain, but he had sheathed his
sword. Behind him entered another, attired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg&nbsp;60]</a></span>
with less magnificence, whom also I had seen
lying on the deck. The Captain, for he was
unquestionably of this rank, had a pale countenance,
a large black beard, and wildly-rolling
eyes, with which he surveyed the whole apartment.
I could see him distinctly, for he moved
over opposite to us; but he appeared not to
observe the door which concealed us. The
two seated themselves at the table, which stood
in the centre of the cabin, and spoke loud and
fast, shouting together in an unknown tongue.
They continually became more noisy and earnest,
until at length, with doubled fist, the
Captain brought the table a blow which shook
the whole apartment. With wild laughter
the other sprang up, and beckoned to the
Captain to follow him. The latter rose, drew
his sabre, and then both left the apartment.
We breathed more freely when they were
away; but our anxiety had still for a long
time no end. Louder and louder became the
noise upon deck; we heard hasty running to
and fro, shouting, laughing, and howling. At
length there came an actually hellish sound,
so that we thought the deck and all the sails
would fall down upon us, the clash of arms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg&nbsp;61]</a></span>
and shrieks&mdash;of a sudden all was deep silence.
When, after many hours, we ventured to go
forth, we found every thing as before; not
one lay differently&mdash;all were as stiff as wooden
figures.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/tosb05.jpg" width="600" height="427"
alt="A ship sails onwards, while nearby a rowing boat overturns in the waves, tipping

</div>

<p>Thus passed we several days on the vessel;
it moved continually towards the East, in
which direction, according to my calculation,
lay the land; but if by day it made many
miles, by night it appeared to go back again,
for we always found ourselves in the same
spot when the sun went down. We could explain
this in no other way, than that the dead
men every night sailed back again with a full
breeze. In order to prevent this, we took
in all the sail before it became night, and
employed the same means as at the door
in the cabin; we wrote on parchment the
name of the Prophet, and also, in addition, the
little stanza of the grandfather, and bound
them upon the furled sail. Anxiously we
awaited the result in our chamber. The ghosts
appeared this time not to rage so wickedly;
and, mark, the next morning the sails were
still rolled up as we had left them. During
the day we extended only as much as was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg&nbsp;62]</a></span>
necessary to bear the ship gently along, and
so in five days we made considerable headway.</p>

<p>At last, on the morning of the sixth day,
we espied land at a short distance, and thanked
Allah and his Prophet for our wonderful deliverance.
This day and the following night
we sailed along the coast, and on the seventh
morning thought we discovered a city at no
great distance: with a good deal of trouble
we cast an anchor into the sea, which soon
reached the bottom; then launching a boat
which stood upon the deck, we rowed with
all our might towards the city. After half an
hour we ran into a river that emptied into the
sea, and stepped ashore. At the gate we inquired
what the place was called, and learned that
it was an Indian city, not far from the region
to which at first I had intended to sail. We
repaired to a Caravansery, and refreshed ourselves
after our adventurous sail. I there inquired
for a wise and intelligent man, at the
same time giving the landlord to understand
that I would like to have one tolerably conversant
with magic. He conducted me to an
unsightly house in a remote street, knocked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg&nbsp;63]</a></span>
thereat, and one let me in with the injunction
that I should ask only for Muley.</p>

<p>In the house, came to me a little old man
with grizzled beard and a long nose, to demand
my business. I told him I was in search of
the wise Muley; he answered me that he
was the man. I then asked his advice as to
what I should do to the dead bodies, and how
I must handle them in order to remove them
from the ship.</p>

<p>He answered me that the people of the ship
were probably enchanted on account of a
crime somewhere upon the sea: he thought
the spell would be dissolved by bringing them
to land, but this could be done only by taking
up the planks on which they lay. In the sight
of God and justice, he said that the ship, together
with all the goods, belonged to me,
since I had, as it were, found it; and, if I
would keep it very secret, and make him a
small present out of my abundance, he would
assist me with his slaves to remove the bodies.
I promised to reward him richly, and we set
out on our expedition with five slaves, who
were supplied with saws and hatchets. On the
way, the magician Muley could not sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg&nbsp;64]</a></span>
praise our happy expedient of binding the sails
around with the sentences from the Koran.
He said this was the only means, by which we
could have saved ourselves.</p>

<p>It was still pretty early in the day when we
reached the ship. We immediately set to
work, and in an hour placed four in the boat.
Some of the slaves were then obliged to row
to land to bury them there. They told us,
when they returned, that the bodies had spared
them the trouble of burying, since, the moment
they laid them on the earth, they had fallen
to dust. We diligently set to work to saw off
the bodies, and before evening all were brought
to land. There were, at last, no more on board
than the one that was nailed to the mast.
Vainly sought we to draw the nail out of the
wood, no strength was able to start it even a
hair&rsquo;s-breadth. I knew not what next to do,
for we could not hew down the mast in order
to bring him to land; but in this dilemma Muley
came to my assistance. He quickly ordered
a slave to row to land and bring a pot
of earth. When he had arrived with it, the
magician pronounced over it some mysterious
words, and cast it on the dead man&rsquo;s head.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg&nbsp;65]</a></span>
Immediately the latter opened his eyes, drew
a deep breath, and the wound of the nail in
his forehead began to bleed. We now drew
it lightly forth, and the wounded man fell into
the arms of one of the slaves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who bore me hither?&rdquo; he exclaimed, after
he seemed to have recovered himself a little.
Muley made signs to me, and I stepped up to
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank thee, unknown stranger; thou hast
freed me from long torment. For fifty years
has my body been sailing through these waves,
and my spirit was condemned to return to it
every night. But now my head has come in
contact with the earth, and, my crime expiated,
I can go to my fathers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I entreated him, thereupon, to tell how he
had been brought to this horrible state, and he
began&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fifty years ago, I was an influential, distinguished
man, and resided in Algiers: a passion
for gain urged me on to fit out a ship, and
turn pirate. I had already followed this business
some time, when once, at Zante, I took
on board a Dervise, who wished to travel for
nothing. I and my companions were impious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg&nbsp;66]</a></span>
men, and paid no respect to the holiness of the
man; I, in particular, made sport of him.
When, however, on one occasion he upbraided
me with holy zeal for my wicked course of life,
that same evening, after I had been drinking
to excess with my pilot in the cabin, anger
overpowered me. Reflecting on what the
Dervise had said to me, which I would not
have borne from a Sultan, I rushed upon deck,
and plunged my dagger into his breast. Dying,
he cursed me and my crew, and doomed
us not to die and not to live, until we should
lay our heads upon the earth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Dervise expired, and we cast him
overboard, laughing at his menaces; that same
night, however, were his words fulfilled. One
portion of my crew rose against me; with terrible
courage the struggle continued, until my
supporters fell, and I myself was nailed to the
mast. The mutineers, however, also sank under
their wounds, and soon my ship was but
one vast grave. My eyes also closed, my
breath stopped&mdash;I thought I was dying. But
it was only a torpor which held me chained:
the following night, at the same hour in which
we had cast the Dervise into the sea, I awoke,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg&nbsp;67]</a></span>
together with all my comrades; life returned,
but we could do and say nothing but what had
been done and said on that fatal night. Thus
we sailed for fifty years, neither living nor dying,
for how could we reach the land? With
mad joy we ever dashed along, with full sails,
before the storm, for we hoped at last to be
wrecked upon some cliff, and to compose our
weary heads to rest upon the bottom of the
sea; but in this we never succeeded. Now
I shall die! Once again, unknown preserver,
accept my thanks, and if treasures can reward
thee, then take my ship in token of my gratitude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words the Captain let his head
drop, and expired. Like his companions, he
immediately fell to dust. We collected this in
a little vessel, and buried it on the shore: and
I took workmen from the city to put the ship
in good condition. After I had exchanged,
with great advantage, the wares I had on board
for others, I hired a crew, richly rewarded my
friend Muley, and set sail for my fatherland.
I took a circuitous route, in the course of which
I landed at several islands and countries, to
bring my goods to market. The Prophet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg&nbsp;68]</a></span>
blessed my undertaking. After several years
I ran into Balsora, twice as rich as the dying
Captain had made me. My fellow-citizens
were amazed at my wealth and good fortune,
and would believe nothing else but that I had
found the diamond-valley of the far-famed
traveller Sinbad. I left them to their belief;
henceforth must the young folks of Balsora,
when they have scarcely arrived at their
eighteenth year, go forth into the world, like
me, to seek their fortunes. I, however, live in
peace and tranquillity, and every five years
make a journey to Mecca, to thank the Lord
for his protection, in that holy place, and to
entreat for the Captain and his crew, that He
will admit them into Paradise.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg&nbsp;69]</a></span>
The march of the Caravan proceeded the
next day without hinderance, and when they
halted, Selim the Stranger began thus to speak
to Muley, the youngest of the merchants:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are, indeed, the youngest of us, nevertheless
you are always in fine spirits, and, to
a certainty, know for us, some right merry
story. Out with it then, that it may refresh
us after the heat of the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might easily tell you something,&rdquo; answered
Muley, &ldquo;which would amuse you, nevertheless
modesty becomes youth in all things;
therefore must my older companions have the
precedence. Zaleukos is ever so grave and
reserved; should not he tell us what has made
his life so serious? Perhaps we could assuage
his grief, if such he have; for gladly would we
serve a brother, even if he belong to another
creed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person alluded to was a Grecian merchant
of middle age, handsome and strongly
built, but very serious. Although he was an
unbeliever, (that is, no Mussulman,) still his
companions were much attached to him, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg&nbsp;70]</a></span>
his whole conduct had inspired them with respect
and confidence. He had only one hand,
and some of his companions conjectured that,
perhaps, this loss gave so grave a tone to his
character. Zaleukos thus answered Muley&rsquo;s
friendly request:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am much honored by your confidence:
grief have I none, at least none from which,
even with your best wishes, you can relieve
me. Nevertheless, since Muley appears to
blame me for my seriousness, I will relate to
you something which will justify me when I
am more grave than others. You see that I
have lost my left hand; this came not to me
at my birth, but I lost it in the most unhappy
days of my life. Whether I bear the fault
thereof, whether I am wrong to be more serious
than my condition in life would seem to
make me, you must decide, when I have told
you the <span class="smcap">Story of the Hewn-off Hand</span>.&rdquo;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="dropcapilrg"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span> WAS born in Constantinople;
my father was a Dragoman
of the Ottoman Porte,
and carried on, besides, a
tolerably lucrative trade in
essences and silk goods. He
gave me a good education,
since he partly superintended it
himself, and partly had me instructed
by one of our priests.
At first, he intended that I should
one day take charge of his business:
but since I displayed greater capacity
than he expected, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg&nbsp;72]</a></span>
advice of his friends, he resolved that I should
study medicine; for a physician, if he only
knows more than a common quack, can make
his fortune in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Many Frenchmen were in the habit of coming
to our house, and one of them prevailed
upon my father to let me go to the city of
Paris, in his fatherland, where one could learn
the profession gratuitously, and with the best
advantages: he himself would take me with
him, at his own expense, when he returned.
My father, who in his youth had also been a
traveller, consented, and the Frenchman told
me to hold myself in readiness in three months.
I was beside myself with delight to see foreign
lands, and could not wait for the moment in
which we should embark. At last the stranger
had finished his business, and was ready to
start.</p>

<p>On the evening preceding our voyage, my
father conducted me into his sleeping apartment;
there I saw fine garments and weapons
lying on the table; but what most attracted
my eye was a large pile of gold, for I had never
before seen so much together. My father
embraced me, and said,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg&nbsp;73]</a></span>
&ldquo;See, my son, I have provided thee with
garments for thy journey. These weapons are
thine; they are those which thy grandfather
hung upon me, when I went forth into foreign
lands. I know thou canst wield them; but use
them not, unless thou art attacked; then, however,
lay on with right good-will. My wealth
is not great; see! I have divided it into three
parts: one is thine; one shall be for my support,
and spare money in case of necessity;
the third shall be sacred and untouched by me,
it may serve thee in the hour of need.&rdquo; Thus
spoke my old father, while tears hung in his
eyes, perhaps from a presentiment, for I have
never seen him since.</p>

<p>Our voyage was favorable; we soon reached
the land of the Franks, and six days&rsquo; journey
brought us to the large city, Paris. Here
my French friend hired me a room, and advised
me to be prudent in spending my money,
which amounted to two thousand thalers. In
this city I lived three years, and learned all
that a well-educated physician should know.
I would be speaking falsely, however, if I said
that I was very happy, for the customs of the
people pleased me not; moreover, I had but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg&nbsp;74]</a></span>
few good friends among them, but these were
young men of nobility.</p>

<p>The longing after my native land at length
became irresistible; during the whole time I
had heard nothing from my father, and I therefore
seized a favorable opportunity to return
home. There was going an embassy from
France to the Supreme Porte: I agreed to
join the train of the ambassador as surgeon,
and soon arrived once more at Stamboul.</p>

<p>My father&rsquo;s dwelling, however, I found
closed, and the neighbors, astonished at seeing
me, said that my father had been dead for
two months. The priest, who had instructed
me in youth, brought me the key. Alone and
forsaken, I entered the desolate house. I found
all as my father had left it; but the gold which
he promised to leave to me, was missing. I inquired
of the priest respecting it, and he bowed
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your father died like a holy man, for he
left his gold to the Church!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was incomprehensible to me; nevertheless,
what could I do? I had no proofs
against the priest, and could only congratulate
myself that he had not also looked upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span>
house, and wares of my father, in the light of
a legacy. This was the first misfortune that
met me; but after this came one upon another.
My reputation as a physician would
not extend itself, because I was ashamed to
play the quack; above all, I missed the recommendation
of my father, who had introduced
me to the richest and most respectable families;
but now they thought no more of the
poor Zaleukos. Moreover, the wares of my
father found no sale, for his customers had
been scattered at his death, and new ones
came only after a long time. One day, as I
was reflecting sorrowfully upon my situation,
it occurred to me that in France I had often
seen countrymen of mine, who travelled
through the land, and exposed their goods
at the market-places of the cities: I recollected
that people gladly purchased of them,
because they came from foreign lands; and
that by such a trade, one could make a hundred-fold.
My resolution was forthwith taken;
I sold my paternal dwelling, gave a portion of
the money obtained thereby to a tried friend
to preserve for me, and with the remainder
purchased such articles as were rare in France,&mdash;shawls,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg&nbsp;76]</a></span>
silken goods, ointments, and oils; for
these I hired a place upon a vessel, and thus
began my second voyage to France. It appeared
as if fortune became favorable to me,
the moment I had the Straits of the Dardanelles
upon my back. Our voyage was short
and prosperous. I travelled through the cities
of France, large and small, and found, in all,
ready purchasers for my goods. My friend in
Stamboul continually sent me fresh supplies,
and I became richer from day to day. At last
when I had husbanded so well, that I believed
myself able to venture on some more extensive
undertaking, I went with my wares into
Italy. I must, however, mention something that
brought me in no little money; I called my
profession also to my assistance. As soon as
I arrived in a city I announced, by means of
bills, that a Grecian physician was there, who
had already cured many; and, truly, my balsam,
and my medicines, had brought me in
many a zechin.</p>

<p>Thus at last I reached the city of Florence,
in Italy. I proposed to myself to remain
longer than usual in this place, partly because
it pleased me so well, partly, moreover, that I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg&nbsp;77]</a></span>
might recover from the fatigues of my journey.
I hired myself a shop in the quarter of the
city called St. Croce, and in a tavern not far
therefrom, took a couple of fine rooms which
led out upon a balcony. Immediately I had
my bills carried around, which announced me
as a physician and merchant. I had no sooner
opened my shop than buyers streamed in upon
me, and although I asked a tolerably high
price, still I sold more than others, because I
was attentive and friendly to my customers.</p>

<p>Well satisfied, I had spent four days in
Florence, when one evening, after I had shut
my shop, and according to custom was examining
my stock of ointment-boxes, I found, in
one of the smaller ones, a letter which I did
not remember to have put in. I opened it and
found therein an invitation to repair that night,
punctually at twelve, to the bridge called the
Ponte Vecchio. For some time I reflected upon
this, as to who it could be that had thus invited
me; as, however, I knew not a soul in Florence,
I thought, as had often happened already,
that one wished to lead me privately to
some sick person. Accordingly I resolved to
go; nevertheless, as a precautionary measure,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg&nbsp;78]</a></span>
I put on the sabre which my father had given
me. As it was fast approaching midnight, I
set out upon my way, and soon arrived at the
Ponte Vecchio; I found the bridge forsaken
and desolate, and resolved to wait until it should
appear who had addressed me.</p>

<p>It was a cold night; the moon shone clear
as I looked down upon the waters of the Arno,
which sparkled in her light. On the church of
the city the twelfth hour was sounding, when I
looked up, and before me stood a tall man, entirely
covered with a red cloak, a corner of
which he held before his face. At this sudden
apparition I was at first somewhat startled, but
I soon recovered myself and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you have summoned me hither, tell me,
what is your pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Red-mantle turned, and solemnly ejaculated,
&ldquo;Follow!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My mind was nevertheless somewhat uneasy
at the idea of going alone with this Unknown;
I stood still and said, &ldquo;Not so, dear sir; you
will first tell me whither; moreover, you may
show me your face a little, that I may see
whether you have good intentions towards
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg&nbsp;79]</a></span>
The Stranger, however, appeared not to be
concerned thereat. &ldquo;If thou wishest it not,
Zaleukos, then remain!&rdquo; answered he, moving
away. At this my anger burned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think you,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;that I will suffer a
man to play the fool with me, and wait here
this cold night for nothing?&rdquo; In three bounds
I reached him; crying still louder, I seized him
by the cloak, laying the other hand upon my
sabre; but the mantle remained in my hand,
and the Unknown vanished around the nearest
corner. My anger gradually cooled; I still
had the cloak, and this should furnish the key
to this strange adventure. I put it on, and
moved towards home. Before I had taken a
hundred steps, somebody passed very near,
and whispered in the French tongue, &ldquo;Observe,
Count, to-night, we can do nothing.&rdquo;
Before I could look around, this somebody
had passed, and I saw only a shadow hovering
near the houses. That this exclamation was
addressed to the mantle, and not to me, I
plainly perceived; nevertheless, this threw no
light upon the matter. Next morning I considered
what was best to be done. At first I
thought of having proclamation made respecting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg&nbsp;80]</a></span>
the cloak, that I had found it; but in that
case the Unknown could send for it by a third
person, and I would have no explanation of
the matter. While thus meditating I took a
nearer view of the garment. It was of heavy
Genoese velvet, of dark red color, bordered
with fur from Astrachan, and richly embroidered
with gold. The gorgeousness of
the cloak suggested to me a plan, which I
resolved to put in execution. I carried it to
my shop and offered it for sale, taking care,
however, to set so high a price upon it, that I
would be certain to find no purchaser. My
object in this was to fix my eye keenly upon
every one who should come to inquire after it;
for the figure of the Unknown, which, after
the loss of the mantle, had been exposed to me
distinctly though transiently, I could recognise
out of thousands. Many merchants came
after the cloak, the extraordinary beauty of
which drew all eyes upon it; but none bore the
slightest resemblance to the Unknown, none
would give for it the high price of two hundred
zechins. It was surprising to me, that
when I asked one and another whether there
was a similar mantle in Florence, all answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg&nbsp;81]</a></span>
in the negative, and protested that they had
never seen such costly and elegant workmanship.</p>

<p>It was just becoming evening, when at last
there came a young man who had often been
in there, and had also that very day bid high
for the mantle; he threw upon the table a bag
of zechins, exclaiming&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heaven! Zaleukos, I must have your
mantle, should I be made a beggar by it.&rdquo;
Immediately he began to count out his gold
pieces. I was in a great dilemma; I had exposed
the mantle, in order thereby to get a
sight of my unknown friend, and now came a
young simpleton to give the unheard-of price.
Nevertheless, what remained for me? I complied,
for on the other hand the reflection consoled
me, that my night adventure would be so
well rewarded. The young man put on the
cloak and departed; he turned, however, upon
the threshold, while he loosened a paper which
was attached to the collar, and threw it towards
me, saying, &ldquo;Here, Zaleukos, hangs
something, that does not properly belong to
my purchase.&rdquo; Indifferently, I received the
note; but lo! these were the contents:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg&nbsp;82]</a></span>
&ldquo;This night, at the hour thou knowest,
bring the mantle to the Ponte Vecchio; four
hundred zechins await thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I stood as one thunder-struck: thus had I
trifled with fortune, and entirely missed my
aim. Nevertheless, I reflected not long; catching
up the two hundred zechins, I bounded to
the side of the young man and said, &ldquo;Take
your zechins again, my good friend, and leave
me the cloak; I cannot possibly part with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first he treated the thing as a jest, but
when he saw it was earnest, he fell in a passion
at my presumption, and called me a fool;
and thus at last we came to blows. I was
fortunate enough to seize the mantle in the
scuffle, and was already making off with it,
when the young man called the police to his
assistance, and had both of us carried before a
court of justice. The magistrate was much
astonished at the accusation, and adjudged the
cloak to my opponent. I however, offered the
young man twenty, fifty, eighty, at last a hundred,
zechins, in addition to his two hundred,
if he would surrender it to me. What my entreaties
could not accomplish, my gold did.
He took my good zechins, while I went off in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg&nbsp;83]</a></span>
triumph with the mantle, obliged to be satisfied
with being taken for a madman by every one
in Florence. Nevertheless, the opinion of the
people was a matter of indifference to me, for
I knew better than they, that I would still gain
by the bargain.</p>

<p>With impatience I awaited the night; at the
same hour as the preceding day, I proceeded
to the Ponte Vecchio, the mantle under my
arm. With the last stroke of the clock, came
the figure out of darkness to my side: beyond
a doubt it was the man of the night before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hast thou the cloak?&rdquo; I was asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but it cost me a hundred
zechins cash.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; rejoined he; &ldquo;look, here are
four hundred.&rdquo; He moved with me to the
broad railing of the bridge and counted out the
gold pieces; brightly they glimmered in the
moonshine, their lustre delighted my heart&mdash;ah!
it did not foresee that this was to be its
last joy. I put the money in my pocket, and
then wished to get a good view of the generous
stranger, but he had a mask before his face,
through which two dark eyes frightfully beamed
upon me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg&nbsp;84]</a></span>
&ldquo;I thank you, sir, for your kindness,&rdquo; said I
to him; &ldquo;what further desire you of me? I
told you before, however, that it must be nothing
evil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unnecessary trouble,&rdquo; answered he, throwing
the cloak over his shoulders; &ldquo;I needed
your assistance as a physician, nevertheless not
for a living, but for a dead person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo; exclaimed I in amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came with my sister from a distant land,&rdquo;
rejoined he, at the same time motioning me to
follow him, &ldquo;and took up my abode with a
friend of our family. A sudden disease carried
off my sister yesterday, and our relations wished
to bury her this morning. According to
an old usage of our family, however, all are to
repose in the sepulchre of our fathers; many
who have died in foreign lands, nevertheless
sleep there embalmed. To my relations now
I grant the body, but to my father must I bring
at least the head of his daughter, that he may
see it once again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this custom of severing the head from
near relatives there was to me, indeed, something
awful; nevertheless, I ventured to say
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg&nbsp;85]</a></span>
nothing against it, through fear of offending
the Unknown. I told him, therefore, that I
was well acquainted with the art of embalming
the dead, and asked him to lead me to the
body. Notwithstanding, I could not keep myself
from inquiring why all this must be done
so secretly in the night. He answered me that
his relations, who considered his purpose inhuman,
would prevent him from accomplishing it
by day; but only let the head once be cut off,
and they could say little more about it: he
could, indeed, have brought the head to me, but
a natural feeling prevented him from cutting
it off himself.</p>

<p>These words brought us to a large splendid
house; my companion pointed it out to me as
the termination of our nocturnal walk. We
passed the principal door, and entering a small
gate, which the stranger carefully closed after
him, ascended, in the dark, a narrow, winding
staircase. This brought us to a dimly-lighted
corridor, from which we entered an apartment;
a lamp, suspended from the ceiling,
shed its brilliant rays around.</p>

<p>In this chamber stood a bed, on which lay
the corpse; the Unknown turned away his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg&nbsp;86]</a></span>
face, as if wishing to conceal his tears. He
beckoned me to the bed, and bidding me set
about my business speedily yet carefully, went
out by the door.</p>

<p>I seized my knives, which, as a physician, I
constantly carried with me, and approached
the bed. Only the head of the corpse was
visible, but that was so beautiful that the deepest
compassion involuntarily came over me.
In long braids the dark hair hung down; the
face was pale, the eyes closed. At first, I
made an incision in the skin, according to the
practice of surgeons when they remove a
limb. Then I took my sharpest knife and cut
entirely through the throat. But, horror! the
dead opened her eyes&mdash;shut them again&mdash;and
in a deep sigh seemed now, for the first time,
to breathe forth her life! Straightway a
stream of hot blood sprang forth from the
wound. I was convinced that I had killed the
poor girl; for that she was dead there could
be no doubt&mdash;from such a wound there was
no chance of recovering. I stood some moments
in anxious wo, thinking on what had
happened. Had the Red-mantle deceived me,
or was his sister, perhaps, only apparently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg&nbsp;87]</a></span>
dead? The latter appeared to me more probable.
Yet I dared not tell the brother of the
deceased, that, perhaps, a less rash blow would
have aroused, without having killed her; therefore
I began to sever the head entirely&mdash;but
once again the dying one groaned, stretched
herself out in a convulsion of pain, and breathed
her last. Then terror overpowered me, and
I rushed shivering out of the apartment.</p>

<p>But outside in the corridor it was dark, for
the lamp had died out; no trace of my companion
was perceptible, and I was obliged to
move along by the wall, at hazard in the dark,
in order to reach the winding-stairs. I found
them at last, and descended, half falling, half
gliding. There was no one below; the door
was only latched, and I breathed more freely
when I was in the street, out of the uneasy atmosphere
of the house. Spurred on by fear, I
ran to my dwelling, and buried myself in the
pillow of my bed, in order to forget the horrid
crime I had committed. But sleep fled my
eyelids, and soon morning admonished me
again to collect myself. It seemed probable to
me, that the man who had led me to this villainous
deed, as it now appeared to me, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg&nbsp;88]</a></span>
not denounce me. I immediately resolved to
attend to my business in my shop, and to put
on as careless an air as possible. But, alas!
a new misfortune, which I now for the first
time observed, augmented my sorrow. My
cap and girdle, as also my knives, were missing;
and I knew not whether they had been
left in the chamber of the dead, or lost during
my flight. Alas! the former seemed more
probable, and they could discover in me the
murderer.</p>

<p>I opened my shop at the usual time; a neighbor
stepped in, as was his custom, being a
communicative man. &ldquo;Ah! what say you to
the horrid deed,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that was committed
last night?&rdquo; I started as if I knew nothing.
&ldquo;How! know you not that with which
the whole city is filled? Know you not that
last night, the fairest flower in Florence, Bianca,
the daughter of the Governor, was murdered?
Ah! only yesterday I saw her walking
happily through the streets with her bridegroom,
for to-day she would have had her nuptial
festival!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every word of my neighbor was a dagger
to my heart; and how often returned my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg&nbsp;89]</a></span>
torments! for each of my customers told me the
story, one more frightfully than another; yet
not one could tell it half so horribly as it had
seemed to me. About mid-day, an officer of
justice unexpectedly walked into my shop, and
asked me to clear it of the bystanders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Signor Zaleukos,&rdquo; said he, showing me the
articles I had lost, &ldquo;belong these things to
you?&rdquo; I reflected whether I should not entirely
disown them; but when I saw through
the half-opened door, my landlord and several
acquaintances, who could readily testify against
me, I determined not to make the matter worse
by a falsehood, and acknowledged the articles
exhibited as my own. The officer told me to
follow him, and conducted me to a spacious
building, which I soon recognised as the prison.
Then, a little farther on, he showed me into an
apartment.</p>

<p>My situation was terrible, as I reflected on
it in my solitude. The thought of having committed
a murder, even against my wish, returned
again and again. Moreover, I could
not conceal from myself that the glance of the
gold had dazzled my senses; otherwise I would
not have fallen so blindly into the snare.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg&nbsp;90]</a></span>
Two hours after my arrest, I was led from
my chamber, and after descending several
flights of stairs, entered a spacious saloon.
Around a long table hung with black, were
seated twelve men, mostly gray with age.
Along the side of the room, benches were arranged,
on which were seated the first people
of Florence. In the gallery, which was built
quite high, stood the spectators, closely crowded
together. As soon as I reached the black
table, a man with a gloomy, sorrowful air arose&mdash;it
was the Governor. He told the audience
that, as a father, he could not judge impartially
in this matter, and that he, for this occasion,
would surrender his seat to the oldest of the
senators. The latter was a gray-headed man,
of at least ninety years. He arose, stooping
beneath the weight of age; his temples were
covered with thin white hair, but his eyes still
burned brightly, and his voice was strong and
steady. He began by asking me whether I
confessed the murder. I entreated his attention,
and with dauntless, distinct voice, related
what I had done and all that I knew. I observed
that the Governor during my recital
turned first pale, then red, and when I concluded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg&nbsp;91]</a></span>
became furious. &ldquo;How, wretch!&rdquo; he
cried out to me, &ldquo;wishest thou thus to lay upon
another, the crime thy avarice has committed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Senator rebuked him for his interruption,
after having of his own free will resigned
his right; moreover, that it was not so clear,
that I had done the deed through avarice, for
according to his own testimony, nothing had
been taken from the corpse. Yes, he went
still further; he told the Governor that he
must give an account of his daughter&rsquo;s early
life, for in this way only could one conclude
whether I had told the truth or not. Immediately
he closed the court for that day, for the
purpose, as he said, of consulting the papers of
the deceased, which the Governor was to give
him. I was carried back to my prison, where
I passed a sorrowful day, constantly occupied
with the ardent hope, that they would in some
way discover the connection between the deceased
and the Red-mantle.</p>

<p>Full of hope, I proceeded the next day to
the justice-hall. Several letters lay upon the
table; the old Senator asked whether they
were of my writing. I looked at them, and
found that they were by the same hand as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg&nbsp;92]</a></span>
both the letters that I had received. This I
disclosed to the Senator; but he seemed to give
but little weight to it, answering that I must
have written both, for the name subscribed
was unquestionably a Z, the initial of my
name. The letters, however, contained menaces
against the deceased, and warnings
against the marriage which she was on the
point of consummating. The Governor seemed
to have imparted something strange and
untrue, with respect to my person; for I was
treated this day with more suspicion and severity.
For my justification, I appealed to
the papers, which would be found in my room,
but I was informed that search had been made
and nothing found. Thus, at the close of the
court, vanished all my hope; and when, on the
third day, I was led again to the hall, the judgment
was read aloud, that I was convicted of
a premeditated murder, and sentenced to death.
To such extremity had I come; forsaken by
all that was dear to me on earth, far from my
native land, innocent and in the bloom of my
years, I was to die by the axe!</p>

<p>On the evening of this terrible day which
had decided my fate, I was seated in my lonely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg&nbsp;93]</a></span>
dungeon, my hopes past, my thoughts seriously
turned upon death, when the door of my prison
opened, and a man entered who regarded me
long in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I see you again, in this situation, Zaleukos?&rdquo;
he began. By the dim light of my
lamp I had not recognised him, but the sound
of his voice awoke within me old recollections.
It was Valetty, one of the few friends I had
made during my studies at Paris. He said
that he had casually come to Florence, where
his father, a distinguished man, resided; he had
heard of my story, and come to see me once
more, to inquire with his own lips, how I could
have been guilty of such an awful crime. I
told him the whole history: he seemed lost in
wonder, and conjured me to tell him, my only
friend, all the truth, and not to depart with a
lie upon my tongue. I swore to him with the
most solemn oath, that I had spoken the truth;
and that no other guilt could be attached to
me, than that, having been blinded by the
glance of the gold, I had not seen the improbability
of the Stranger&rsquo;s story. &ldquo;Then did you
not know Bianca?&rdquo; asked he. I assured him
that I had never seen her. Valetty thereupon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg&nbsp;94]</a></span>
told me that there was a deep mystery in the
matter; that the Governor in great haste had
urged my condemnation, and that a report
was current among the people, that I had
known Bianca for a long time, and had murdered
her out of revenge for her intended marriage
with another. I informed him that all this
was probably true of the Red-mantle, but that
I could not prove his participation in the deed.
Valetty embraced me, weeping, and promised
me to do all that he could; to save my life, if
nothing more. I had not much hope; nevertheless,
I knew that my friend was a wise man,
and well acquainted with the laws, and that
he would do all in his power to preserve me.</p>

<p>Two long days was I in suspense; at length
Valetty appeared. &ldquo;I bring consolation, though
even that is attended with sorrow. You shall
live and be free, but with the loss of a hand!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overjoyed, I thanked my friend for my life.
He told me that the Governor had been inexorable,
and would not once look into the matter:
that at length, however, rather than appear
unjust, he had agreed, if a similar case could
be found in the annals of Florentine history,
that my penalty should be regulated by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg&nbsp;95]</a></span>
punishment that was then inflicted. He and
his father had searched, day and night, in the
old books, and had at length found a case similar
in every respect to mine; the sentence there
ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He shall have his left hand cut off; his
goods shall be confiscated, and he himself banished
forever!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such now was my sentence, also, and I was
to prepare for the painful hour that awaited
me. I will not bring before your eyes the
frightful moment, in which, at the open market-place,
I laid my hand upon the block; in
which my own blood in thick streams flowed
over me!</p>

<p>Valetty took me to his house until I had recovered,
and then generously supplied me with
money for my journey, for all that I had so laboriously
acquired was confiscated to Justice.
I went from Florence to Sicily, and thence, by
the first ship I could find, to Constantinople.
My hopes, which rested on the sum of money
I had left with my friend, were not disappointed.
I proposed that I should live with him&mdash;how
astonished was I, when he asked why I
occupied not my own house! He told me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg&nbsp;96]</a></span>
that a strange man had, in my name, bought a
house in the quarter of the Greeks, and told
the neighbors that I would soon, myself, return.
I immediately proceeded to it with my
friend, and was joyfully received by all my old
acquaintances. An aged merchant handed me
a letter which the man who purchased for
me had left. I read:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zaleukos! two hands stand ready to work
unceasingly, that thou mayest not feel the loss
of one. That house which thou seest and all
therein are thine, and every year shalt thou
receive so much, that thou shalt be among the
rich of thy nation. Mayest thou forgive one
who is more unhappy than thyself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I could guess who was the writer, and the
merchant told me, in answer to my inquiry
that it was a man covered with a red cloak,
whom he had taken for a Frenchman. I knew
enough to convince me that the Unknown
was not entirely devoid of generous feeling.
In my new house I found all arranged in the
best style; a shop, moreover, full of wares,
finer than any I had ever had. Ten years
have elapsed since then; more in compliance
with ancient custom, than because it is necessary,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span>
do I continue to travel in foreign lands
for purposes of trade, but the land which was
so fatal to me I have never seen since. Every
year I receive a thousand pieces of gold; but
although it rejoices me to know that this
Unfortunate is so noble, still can his money
never remove wo from my soul, for there
lives forever the heart-rending image of the
murdered Bianca!</p>

</div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Thus ended the story of Zaleukos, the
Grecian merchant. With great interest had
the others listened; the stranger, in particular,
seemed to be wrapt up in it: more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg&nbsp;98]</a></span>
once he had drawn a deep sigh, and Muley
looked as if he had had tears in his eyes.
No one spoke for some time after the recital.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And hate you not the Unknown, who so
basely cost you a noble member of your body,
and even put your life in danger?&rdquo; inquired
Selim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps there were hours at first,&rdquo; answered
the Greek, &ldquo;in which my heart accused
him before God, of having brought this
misfortune upon me, and embittered my life;
but I found consolation in the religion of my
fathers, which commanded me to love my enemies.
Moreover, he probably is more unhappy
than myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a noble man!&rdquo; exclaimed Selim,
cordially pressing the hand of the Greek.</p>

<p>The leader of the escort, however, here interrupted
their conversation. He came with a
troubled air into the tent, and told them that
they could not give themselves up to repose,
for this was the place in which Caravans were
usually attacked, and his guards imagined they
had seen several horsemen in the distance.</p>

<p>The merchants were confounded at this intelligence.
Selim, the stranger, however,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span>
expressed wonder at their alarm, saying they
were so well escorted they need not fear a
troop of Arabian robbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; rejoined to him the leader of the
guard; &ldquo;were he only a common outlaw, we
could compose ourselves to rest without anxiety;
but for some time back, the frightful
Orbasan has shown himself again, and it is
well to be upon our guard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger inquired who this Orbasan
was, and Achmet, the old merchant, answered
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Various rumors are current among the
people with respect to this wonderful man.
Some hold him to be a supernatural being,
because, with only five or six men, he
has frequently fallen upon a whole encampment;
others regard him as a bold Frenchman,
whom misfortune has driven into this
region: out of all this, however, thus much
alone is certain, that he is an abandoned robber
and highwayman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That can you not prove,&rdquo; answered Lezah,
one of the merchants. &ldquo;Robber as he is, he
is still a noble man, and such has he shown
himself to my brother, as I can relate to you.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg&nbsp;100]</a></span>
He has formed his whole band of well-disciplined
men, and as long as he marches through
the desert, no other band ventures to show
itself. Moreover, he robs not as others, but
only exacts a tribute from the caravans; whoever
willingly pays this, proceeds without further
danger, for Orbasan is lord of the wilderness!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus did the travellers converse together in
the tent; the guards, however, who were stationed
around the resting-place, began to become
uneasy. A tolerably large band of
armed horsemen showed themselves at the
distance of half a league. They appeared to
be riding straight to the encampment; one of
the guard came into the tent, to inform them
that they would probably be attacked.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/tosb09.jpg" width="600" height="475"
alt="A small encampment, with a few people and some cattle visible" />
</div>

<p>The merchants consulted among themselves
as to what they should do, whether to march
against them, or await the attack. Achmet
and the two elder merchants inclined to the
latter course; the fiery Muley, however, and
Zaleukos desired the former, and summoned
the stranger to their assistance. He, however,
quietly drew forth from his girdle a little blue
cloth spangled with red stars, bound it upon a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg&nbsp;101]</a></span>
lance, and commanded one of the slaves to
plant it in front of the tent: he would venture
his life upon it, he said, that the horsemen,
when they saw this signal, would quietly march
back again. Muley trusted not the result;
still the slave put out the lance in front of the
tent. Meanwhile all in the camp had seized
their weapons, and were looking upon the
horsemen in eager expectation. The latter,
however, appeared to have espied the signal;
they suddenly swerved from their direct
course towards the encampment, and, in a
large circle, moved off to the side.</p>

<p>Struck with wonder, the travellers stood
some moments, gazing alternately at the horsemen
and the stranger. The latter stood in
front of the tent quite indifferently, as though
nothing had happened, looking upon the plain
before him. At last Muley broke the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, mighty stranger,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;that restrainest with a glance the
wild hordes of the desert?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rate my art higher than it deserves,&rdquo;
answered Selim Baruch. &ldquo;I observed this
signal when I fled from captivity; what it
means, I know not&mdash;only this much I know,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg&nbsp;102]</a></span>
that whoever travels with this sign, is under
great protection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The merchants thanked the stranger, and
called him their preserver; indeed, the number
of the robbers was so great, that the Caravan
could not, probably, for any length of time,
have offered an effectual resistance.</p>

<p>With lighter hearts they now gave themselves
to sleep; and when the sun began to
sink, and the evening wind to pass over the
sand-plain, they struck their tents, and marched
on. The next day they halted safely, only
one day&rsquo;s journey from the entrance of the
desert. When the travellers had once more
collected in the large tent, Lezah, the merchant,
took up the discourse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you, yesterday, that the dreaded Orbasan
was a noble man; permit me to prove it
to you, to-day, by the relation of my brother&rsquo;s
adventure. My father was Cadi of Acara.
He had three children; I was the eldest, my
brother and sister being much younger than
myself. When I was twenty years old, a
brother of my father took me under his protection;
he made me heir to his property, on
condition that I should remain with him until
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg&nbsp;103]</a></span>
his death. He however had reached an old
age, so that before two years I returned to my
native land, having known nothing, before, of
the misfortune which had meanwhile fallen
upon my family, and how Allah had turned it
to advantage.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg&nbsp;104]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/tosb10.png" width="600" height="434"
alt="Decorative title, FATIMA&rsquo;S DELIVERANCE." />
</div>


<p><span class="dropcapmlrg"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>Y brother Mustapha and
my sister Fatima were almost
of the same age; the
former was at most but two
years older. They loved
each other fervently, and
did in concert, all that
could lighten, for our suffering
father, the burden of his old
age. On Fatima&rsquo;s seventeenth
birthday, my brother prepared
a festival. He invited all her companions,
and set before them a
choice banquet in the gardens of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg&nbsp;105]</a></span>
our father, and, towards evening, proposed to
them to take a little sail upon the sea, in a
boat which he had hired, and adorned in grand
style. Fatima and her companions agreed
with joy, for the evening was fine, and the
city, particularly when viewed by evening
from the sea, promised a magnificent prospect.
The girls, however, were so well pleased upon
the bark, that they continually entreated my
brother to go farther out upon the sea. Mustapha,
however, yielded reluctantly, because a
Corsair had been seen, for several days back, in
that vicinity.</p>

<p>Not far from the city, a promontory projected
into the sea; thither the maidens were
anxious to go, in order to see the sun sink into
the water. Having rowed thither, they beheld
a boat occupied by armed men. Anticipating
no good, my brother commanded the oarsmen
to turn the vessel, and make for land. His
apprehensions seemed, indeed, to be confirmed,
for the boat quickly approached that of my
brother, and getting ahead of it, (for it had
more rowers,) ran between it and the land.
The young girls, moreover, when they knew
the danger to which they were exposed, sprang
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg&nbsp;106]</a></span>
up with cries and lamentations: in vain Mustapha
sought to quiet them, in vain enjoined
upon them to be still, lest their running to and
fro should upset the vessel. It was of no
avail; and when, in consequence of the
proximity of the other boat, all ran upon the
further side, it was upset.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, they had observed from the
land the approach of the strange boat, and,
inasmuch as, for some time back, they had
been in anxiety on account of Corsairs, their
suspicions were excited, and several boats put
off from the land to their assistance: but they
only came in time to pick up the drowning.
In the confusion, the hostile boat escaped. In
both barks, however, which had taken in those
who were preserved, they were uncertain
whether all had been saved. They approached
each other, and, alas! found that my sister
and one of her companions were missing; at
the same time, in their number a stranger was
discovered, who was known to none. In answer
to Mustapha&rsquo;s threats, he confessed that
he belonged to the hostile ship, which was lying
at anchor two miles to the eastward, and
that his companions had left him behind in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg&nbsp;107]</a></span>
their hasty flight, while he was engaged in
assisting to pick up the maidens; moreover,
he said he had seen two taken on board their
boat.</p>

<p>The grief of my old father was without
bounds, but Mustapha also was afflicted unto
death, for not only had his beloved sister
been lost, and did he accuse himself of having
been the cause of her misfortune, but, also,
her companion who had shared it with her,
had been promised to him by her parents as
his wife; still had he not dared to avow it to
our father, because her family was poor, and
of low descent. My father, however, was a
stern man; as soon as his sorrow had subsided
a little, he called Mustapha before him, and
thus spake to him:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy folly has deprived me of the consolation
of my old age, and the joy of my eyes.
Go! I banish thee forever from my sight! I
curse thee and thine offspring&mdash;and only when
thou shalt restore to me my Fatima, shall thy
head be entirely free from a father&rsquo;s execrations!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This my poor brother had not expected;
already, before this, he had determined to go in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg&nbsp;108]</a></span>
search of his sister and her friend, after having
asked the blessing of his father upon his efforts,
and now that father had sent him forth into the
world, laden with his curse. As, however, his
former grief had bowed him down, so this consummation
of misfortune, which he had not
deserved, tended to steel his mind. He went to
the imprisoned pirate, and, demanding whither
the ship was bound, learned that she carried on
a trade in slaves, and usually had a great sale
thereof in Balsora.</p>

<p>On his return to the house, in order to prepare
for his journey, the anger of his father
seemed to have subsided a little, for he sent
him a purse full of gold, to support him during
his travels. Mustapha, thereupon, in tears
took leave of the parents of Zoraida, (for so his
affianced was called,) and set out upon the
route to Balsora.</p>

<p>Mustapha travelled by land, because from
our little city there was no ship that went direct
to Balsora. He was obliged, therefore, to
use all expedition, in order not to arrive too
long after the sea-robbers. Having a good
horse and no luggage, he hoped to reach this
city by the end of the sixth day. On the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg&nbsp;109]</a></span>
evening of the fourth, however, as he was
riding all alone upon his way, three men came
suddenly upon him. Having observed that
they were well-armed and powerful men, and
sought his money and his horse, rather than
his life, he cried out that he would yield himself
to them. They dismounted, and tied his
feet together under his horse; then they placed
him in their midst, and, without a word spoken,
trotted quickly away with him; one of them
having seized his bridle.</p>

<p>Mustapha gave himself up to a feeling of
gloomy despair; the curse of his father seemed
already to be undergoing its accomplishment on
the unfortunate one, and how could he hope to
save his sister and Zoraida, should he, robbed
of all his means, even be able to devote his poor
life to their deliverance? Mustapha and his
silent companions might have ridden about an
hour, when they entered a little valley. The
vale was enclosed by lofty trees; a soft, dark-green
turf, and a stream which ran swiftly
through its midst, invited to repose. In this
place were pitched from fifteen to twenty
tents, to the stakes of which were fastened
camels and fine horses: from one of these tents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg&nbsp;110]</a></span>
distinctly sounded the melody of a guitar,
blended with two fine manly voices. It seemed
to my brother as if people who had chosen
so blithesome a resting-place, could have no
evil intentions towards himself; and accordingly,
without apprehension, he obeyed the summons
of his conductors, who had unbound his
feet, and made signs to him to follow. They
led him into a tent which was larger than the
rest, and on the inside was magnificently fitted
up. Splendid cushions embroidered with gold,
woven carpets, gilded censers, would elsewhere
have bespoken opulence and respectability,
but here seemed only the booty of a robber
band. Upon one of the cushions an old and
small-sized man was reclining: his countenance
was ugly; a dark-brown and shining skin, a
disgusting expression around his eyes, and a
mouth of malicious cunning, combined to render
his whole appearance odious. Although
this man sought to put on a commanding air,
still Mustapha soon perceived that not for him
was the tent so richly adorned, and the conversation
of his conductors seemed to confirm him
in his opinion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg&nbsp;111]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where is the Mighty?&rdquo; inquired they of
the little man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is out upon a short hunt,&rdquo; was the answer;
&ldquo;but he has commissioned me to attend
to his affairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That has he not wisely done,&rdquo; rejoined
one of the robbers; &ldquo;for it must soon be determined
whether this dog is to die or be ransomed,
and that the Mighty knows better than
thou.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being very sensitive in all that related to
his usurped dignity, the little man, raising
himself, stretched forward in order to reach
the other&rsquo;s ear with the extremity of his hand,
for he seemed desirous of revenging himself by
a blow; but when he saw that his attempt was
fruitless, he set about abusing him (and indeed
the others did not remain much in his debt) to
such a degree, that the tent resounded with
their strife. Thereupon, of a sudden, the tent-door
opened, and in walked a tall, stately
man, young and handsome as a Persian
prince. His garments and weapons, with
the exception of a richly-mounted poniard
and gleaming sabre, were plain and simple;
his serious eye, however, and his whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg&nbsp;112]</a></span>
appearance, demanded respect without exciting
fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it that dares to engage in strife
within my tent?&rdquo; exclaimed he, as they started
back aghast. For a long time deep stillness
prevailed, till at last one of those who had captured
Mustapha, related to him how it had begun.
Thereupon the countenance of &ldquo;the
Mighty,&rdquo; as they had called him, seemed to
grow red with passion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When would I have placed thee, Hassan,
over my concerns?&rdquo; he cried, in frightful accents,
to the little man. The latter, in his fear,
shrunk until he seemed even smaller than before,
and crept towards the door of the tent.
One step of the Mighty was sufficient to send
him through the entrance with a long singular
bound. As soon as the little man had vanished,
the three led Mustapha before the master
of the tent, who had meanwhile reclined upon
the cushion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here bring we thee him, whom thou commandedst
us to take.&rdquo; He regarded the prisoner
for some time, and then said, &ldquo;Bashaw
of Sulieika, thine own conscience will tell thee
why thou standest before Orbasan.&rdquo; When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg&nbsp;113]</a></span>
my brother heard this, he bowed low and answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My lord, you appear to labor under a mistake;
I am a poor unfortunate, not the Bashaw,
whom you seek.&rdquo; At this all were amazed;
the master of the tent, however, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dissimulation can help you little, for I will
summon the people who know you well.&rdquo; He
commanded them to bring in Zuleima. An
old woman was led into the tent, who, on being
asked whether in my brother she recognised
the Bashaw of Sulieika, answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, verily! And I swear by the grave
of the Prophet, it is the Bashaw, and no
other!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seest thou, wretch, that thy dissimulation
has become as water?&rdquo; cried out the Mighty
in a furious tone. &ldquo;Thou art too pitiful for
me to stain my good dagger with thy blood,
but to-morrow, when the sun is up, will I bind
thee to the tail of my horse, and gallop with
thee through the woods, until they separate
behind the hills of Sulieika!&rdquo; Then sank my
poor brother&rsquo;s courage within him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is my cruel father&rsquo;s curse, that urges me
to an ignominious death,&rdquo; exclaimed he, weeping;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg&nbsp;114]</a></span>
&ldquo;and thou, too, art lost, sweet sister, and
thou, Zoraida!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thy dissimulation helps thee not,&rdquo; said one
of the robbers, as he bound his hands behind
his back. &ldquo;Come, out of the tent with thee!
for the Mighty is biting his lips, and feeling for
his dagger. If thou wouldst live another night,
bestir thyself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the robbers were leading my brother
from the tent, they met three of their companions,
who were also pushing a captive before
them. They entered with him. &ldquo;Here bring
we the Bashaw, as thou hast commanded,&rdquo; said
they, conducting the prisoner before the cushion
of the Mighty. While they were so doing,
my brother had an opportunity of examining
him, and was struck with surprise at the remarkable
resemblance which this man bore to
himself; the only difference being, that he was
of more gloomy aspect, and had a black beard.
The Mighty seemed much astonished at the
resemblance of the two captives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which of you is the right one?&rdquo; he asked,
looking alternately at Mustapha and the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thou meanest the Bashaw of Sulieika,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg&nbsp;115]</a></span>
answered the latter in a haughty tone, &ldquo;I am
he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Mighty regarded him for a long time
with his grave, terrible eye, and then silently
motioned to them to lead him off. This having
been done, he approached my brother, severed
his bonds with his dagger, and invited him by
signs to sit upon the cushion beside him. &ldquo;It
grieves me, stranger,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I took
you for this villain. It has happened, however,
by some mysterious interposition of Providence,
which placed you in the hands of my companions,
at the very hour in which the destruction
of this wretch was ordained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mustapha, thereupon, entreated him only for
permission to pursue his journey immediately,
for this delay might cost him much. The
Mighty asked what business it could be that
required such haste, and, when Mustapha had
told him all, he persuaded him to spend that
night in his tent, and allow his horse some rest;
and promised the next morning to show him a
route which would bring him to Balsora in a
day and a half. My brother consented, was
sumptuously entertained, and slept soundly till
morning in the robber&rsquo;s tent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span>
Upon awaking, he found himself all alone in
the tent, but, before the entrance, heard several
voices in conversation, which seemed to belong
to the swarthy little man and the bandit-chief.
He listened awhile, and to his horror
heard the little man eagerly urging the other
to slay the stranger, since, if he were let go,
he could betray them all. Mustapha immediately
perceived that the little man hated him,
for having been the cause of his rough treatment
the day before. The Mighty seemed to
be reflecting a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;he is my guest, and the
laws of hospitality are with me sacred: moreover,
he does not look like one that would betray
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, he threw back the tent-cover,
and walked in. &ldquo;Peace be with thee,
Mustapha!&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;let us taste the morning-drink,
and then prepare thyself for thy journey.&rdquo;
He offered my brother a cup of sherbet, and
after they had drunk, they saddled their horses,
and Mustapha mounted, with a lighter heart,
indeed, than when he entered the vale. They
had soon turned their backs upon the tents,
and took a broad path, which led into the forest.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span>
The Mighty informed my brother, that
this Bashaw whom they had captured in the
chase, had promised them that they should remain
undisturbed within his jurisdiction; but
some weeks before, he had taken one of their
bravest men, and had him hung, after the most
terrible tortures. He had waited for him a
long time, and to-day he must die. Mustapha
ventured not to say a word in opposition, for
he was glad to have escaped himself with a
whole skin.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the forest, the Mighty
checked his horse, showed Mustapha the way,
and gave him his hand with these words:
&ldquo;Mustapha, thou becamest in a strange way
the guest of the robber Orbasan. I will not
ask thee not to betray what thou hast seen and
heard. Thou hast unjustly endured the pains
of death, and I owe thee a recompense. Take
this dagger as a remembrance, and when thou
hast need of help, send it to me, and I will
hasten to thy assistance. This purse thou wilt
perhaps need upon thy journey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My brother thanked him for his generosity;
he took the dagger, but refused the purse.
Orbasan, however, pressed once again his hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span>
let the money fall to the ground, and galloped
with the speed of the wind into the forest.
Mustapha, seeing that he could not overtake
him, dismounted to secure the purse, and was
astonished at the great magnanimity of his
host, for it contained a large sum of gold. He
thanked Allah for his deliverance, commended
the generous robber to his mercy, and again
started, with fresh courage, upon the route to
Balsora.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Lezah paused, and looked inquiringly at
Achmet, the old merchant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! if it be so,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;then will
I gladly correct my opinion of Orbasan; for
indeed he acted nobly towards thy brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He behaved like a brave Mussulman,&rdquo; exclaimed
Muley; &ldquo;but I hope thou hast not
here finished thy story, for, as it seems to me,
we are all eager to hear still further, how it went
with thy brother, and whether he succeeded
in rescuing thy sister and the fair Zoraida.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will willingly proceed,&rdquo; rejoined Lezah,
&ldquo;if it be not tiresome to you; for my brother&rsquo;s
history is, throughout, full of the most wonderful
adventures.&rdquo;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span>
About the middle of the seventh day after
his departure, Mustapha entered the gate of
Balsora. As soon as he had arrived at a caravansery,
he inquired whether the slave-market,
which was held here every year, had
opened; but received the startling answer,
that he had come two days too late. His informer
deplored his tardiness, telling him that
on the last day of the market, two female slaves
had arrived, of such great beauty as to attract
to themselves the eyes of all the merchants.</p>

<p>He inquired more particularly as to their
appearance, and there was no doubt in his
mind, that they were the unfortunate ones of
whom he was in search. Moreover, he learned
that the man who had purchased them both,
was called Thiuli-Kos, and lived forty leagues
from Balsora, an illustrious and wealthy, but
quite old man, who had been in his early years
Capudan-Bashaw of the Sultan, but had now
settled down into private life with the riches
he had acquired.</p>

<p>Mustapha was, at first, on the point of remounting
his horse with all possible speed, in
order to overtake Thiuli-Kos, who could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span>
scarcely have had a day&rsquo;s start; but when he
reflected that, as a single man, he could not
prevail against the powerful traveller, could
still less rescue from him his prey, he set about
reflecting for another plan, and soon hit upon
one. His resemblance to the Bashaw of Sulieika,
which had almost been fatal to him, suggested
to him the thought of going to the house
of Thiuli-Kos under this name, and, in that
way, making an attempt for the deliverance of
the two unfortunate maidens. Accordingly
he hired attendants and horses, in which the
money of Orbasan opportunely came to his assistance,
furnished himself and his servants
with splendid garments, and set out in the direction
of Thiuli&rsquo;s castle. After five days he
arrived in its vicinity. It was situated in a
beautiful plain, and was surrounded on all sides
by lofty walls, which were but slightly overtopped
by the structure itself. When Mustapha
had arrived quite near, he dyed his hair
and beard black, and stained his face with the
juice of a plant, which gave it a brownish color,
exactly similar to that of the Bashaw. From
this place he sent forward one of his attendants
to the castle, and bade him ask a night&rsquo;s lodging,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span>
in the name of the Bashaw of Sulieika.
The servant soon returned in company with
four finely-attired slaves, who took Mustapha&rsquo;s
horse by the bridle, and led him into the court-yard.
There they assisted him to dismount,
and four others escorted him up a wide marble
staircase, into the presence of Thiuli.</p>

<p>The latter personage, an old, robust man,
received my brother respectfully, and had set
before him the best that his castle could afford.
After the meal, Mustapha gradually turned
the conversation upon the new slaves; whereupon,
Thiuli praised their beauty, but expressed
regret because they were so sorrowful;
nevertheless he believed that would go
over after a time. My brother was much delighted
at his reception, and, with hope beating
high in his bosom, lay down to rest.</p>

<p>He might, perhaps, have been sleeping an
hour, when he was awakened by the rays of
a lamp, which fell dazzlingly upon his eyes.
When he had raised himself up, he believed
himself dreaming, for there before him stood
the very same little, swarthy fellow of Orbasan&rsquo;s
tent, a lamp in his hand, his wide mouth
distended with a disgusting laugh. Mustapha
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span>
pinched himself in the arm, and pulled his
nose, in order to see if he were really awake,
but the figure remained as before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wishest thou by my bed?&rdquo; exclaimed
Mustapha, recovering from his amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not disquiet yourself so much, my
friend,&rdquo; answered the little man. &ldquo;I made
a good guess as to the motive that brought
you hither. Although your worthy countenance
was still well remembered by me, nevertheless,
had I not with my own hand assisted
to hang the Bashaw, you might, perhaps, have
deceived even me. Now, however, I am here
to propose a question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all, tell me why you came hither,&rdquo;
interrupted Mustapha, full of resentment at
finding himself detected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That I will explain to you,&rdquo; rejoined the
other: &ldquo;I could not put up with the Mighty
any longer, and therefore ran away; but you,
Mustapha, were properly the cause of our
quarrel, and so you must give me your sister
to wife, and I will help you in your flight;
give her not, and I will go to my new master,
and tell him something of our new Bashaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg&nbsp;123]</a></span>
Mustapha was beside himself with fear and
anger; at the very moment when he thought
he had arrived at the happy accomplishment of
his wishes, must this wretch come, and frustrate
them all! It was the only way to carry
his plan into execution&mdash;he must slay the
little monster: with one bound, he sprang
from the bed upon him; but the other, who
might perhaps have anticipated something of
the kind, let the lamp fall, which was immediately
extinguished, and rushed forth in the
dark, crying vehemently for help.</p>

<p>Now was the time for decisive action; the
maids he was obliged, for the moment, to abandon,
and attend only to his own safety: accordingly,
he approached the window, to see
if he could not spring from it. It was a tolerable
distance from the ground, and on the
other side stood a lofty wall, which he would
have to surmount. Reflecting, he stood by
the window until he heard many voices approaching
his chamber: already were they at
the door, when seizing desperately his dagger,
and garments, he let himself down from the
window. The fall was hard, but he felt that
no bone was broken; immediately he sprang
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg&nbsp;124]</a></span>
up, and ran to the wall which surrounded the
court. This, to the astonishment of his pursuers,
he mounted, and soon found himself at
liberty. He ran on until he came to a little
forest, where he sank down exhausted. Here
he reflected on what was to be done; his
horses and attendants he was obliged to leave
behind, but the money, which he had placed in
his girdle, he had saved.</p>

<p>His inventive genius, however, soon pointed
him to another means of deliverance. He
walked through the wood until he arrived at a
village, where for a small sum he purchased a
horse, with the help of which, in a short time,
he reached a city. There he inquired for a
physician, and was directed to an old experienced
man. On this one he prevailed, by a
few gold pieces, to furnish him with a medicine
to produce a death-like sleep, which, by means
of another, might be instantaneously removed.
Having obtained this, he purchased a long
false beard, a black gown, and various boxes
and retorts, so that he could readily pass for a
travelling physician; these articles he placed
upon an ass, and rode back to the castle of
Thiuli-Kos. He was certain, this time, of not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span>
being recognised, for the beard disfigured him
so that he scarcely knew himself.</p>

<p>Arrived in the vicinity of the castle, he announced
himself as the physician Chakamankabudibaba,
and matters turned out as he had
expected. The splendor of the name procured
him extraordinary favor with the old fool, who
invited him to table. Chakamankabudibaba
appeared before Thiuli, and, having conversed
with him scarcely an hour, the old man resolved
that all his female slaves should submit
to the examination of the wise physician.
The latter could scarcely conceal his joy at
the idea of once more beholding his beloved
sister, and with palpitating heart followed Thiuli,
who conducted him to his seraglio. They
reached an unoccupied room, which was beautifully
furnished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chambaba, or whatever thou mayest be
called, my good physician,&rdquo; said Thiuli-Kos,
&ldquo;look once at that hole in the wall; thence
shall each of my slaves stretch forth her arm,
and thou canst feel whether the pulse betoken
sickness or health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Answer as he might, Mustapha could not
arrange it so that he might see them;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span>
nevertheless, Thiuli agreed to tell him, each time,
the usual health of the one he was examining.
Thiuli drew forth a long list from his girdle,
and began, with loud voice, to call out, one by
one, the names of his slaves; whereupon, each
time, a hand came forth from the wall, and
the physician felt the pulse. Six had been
read off, and declared entirely well, when Thiuli,
for the seventh called Fatima, and a small
white hand slipped forth from the wall. Trembling
with joy, Mustapha grasped it, and with
an important air pronounced her seriously ill.
Thiuli became very anxious, and commanded
his wise Chakamankabudibaba straightway to
prescribe some medicine for her. The physician
left the room, and wrote a little scroll:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fatima, I will preserve thee, if thou canst
make up thy mind to take a draught, which for
two days will make thee dead; nevertheless, I
possess the means of restoring thee to life. If
thou wilt, then only return answer, that this
liquid has been of no assistance, and it will be
to me a token that thou agreest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a moment he returned to the room, where
Thiuli had remained. He brought with him
an innocent drink, felt the pulse of the sick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span>
Fatima once more, pushed the note beneath
her bracelet, and then handed her the liquid
through the opening in the wall. Thiuli seemed
to be in great anxiety on Fatima&rsquo;s account, and
postponed the examination of the rest to a more
fitting opportunity. As he left the room with
Mustapha, he addressed him in sorrowful accents:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chadibaba, tell me plainly, what thinkest
thou of Fatima&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My brother answered with a deep sigh:
&ldquo;Ah, sir, may the Prophet give you consolation!
she has a slow fever, which may, perhaps,
cost her life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then burned Thiuli&rsquo;s anger: &ldquo;What sayest
thou, cursed dog of a physician? She, for
whom I gave two thousand gold pieces&mdash;shall
she die like a cow? Know, if thou preservest
her not, I will chop off thine head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>My brother immediately saw that he had
made a misstep, and again inspired Thiuli with
hope. While they were yet conversing, a
black slave came from the seraglio to tell the
physician, that the drink had been of no assistance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put forth all thy skill, Chakamdababelda,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span>
or whatever thy name may be; I will pay
thee what thou askest!&rdquo; cried out Thiuli-Kos,
well-nigh howling with sorrow, at the idea of
losing so much gold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give her a potion, which will put her
out of all danger,&rdquo; answered the physician.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes!&mdash;give it her,&rdquo; sobbed the old
Thiuli.</p>

<p>With joyful heart Mustapha went to bring
his soporific, and having given it to the black
slave, and shown him how much it was necessary
to take for a dose, he went to Thiuli, and,
telling him he must procure some medicinal
herbs from the sea, hastened through the gate.
On the shore, which was not far from the castle,
he removed his false garments, and cast
them into the water, where they floated merrily
around; concealing himself, however, in a
thicket, he awaited the night, and then stole
softly to the burying-place of Thiuli&rsquo;s castle.</p>

<p>Hardly an hour had Mustapha been absent,
when they brought Thiuli the intelligence that
his slave Fatima was in the agonies of death.
He sent them to the sea-coast to bring the
physician back with all speed, but his messengers
returned alone, with the news that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span>
poor physician had fallen into the water, and
was drowned; that they had espied his black
gown floating upon the surface, and that now
and then his large beard peeped forth from
amid the billows. Thiuli seeing now no help,
cursed himself and the whole world; plucked
his beard, and dashed his head against the
wall. But all this was of no use, for soon
Fatima gave up the ghost, in the arms of her
companions. When the unfortunate man
heard the news of her death, he commanded
them quickly to make a coffin, for he could
not tolerate a dead person in his house; and
bade them bear forth the corpse to the place of
burial. The carriers brought in the coffin, but
quickly set it down and fled, for they heard
sighs and sobs among the other piles.</p>

<p>Mustapha, who, concealed behind the coffins,
had inspired the attendants with such terror,
came forth and lighted a lamp, which he had
brought for that purpose. Then he drew out
a vial which contained the life-restoring medicine,
and lifted the lid of Fatima&rsquo;s coffin. But
what amazement seized him, when by the light
of the lamp, strange features met his gaze!
Neither my sister, nor Zoraida, but an entire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span>
stranger, lay in the coffin! It was some time
before he could recover from this new stroke
of destiny; at last, however, compassion triumphed
over anger. He opened the vial, and
administered the liquid. She breathed&mdash;she
opened her eyes&mdash;and seemed for some time
to be reflecting where she was. At length,
recalling all that had happened, she rose from
the coffin, and threw herself, sobbing, at Mustapha&rsquo;s
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How may I thank thee, excellent being,&rdquo;
she exclaimed, &ldquo;for having freed me from my
frightful prison?&rdquo; Mustapha interrupted her
expressions of gratitude by inquiring, how it
happened that she, and not his sister Fatima,
had been preserved. The maiden looked in
amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now is my deliverance explained, which
was before incomprehensible,&rdquo; answered she.
&ldquo;Know that in this castle I am called Fatima,
and it was to me thou gavest thy note, and the
preserving-drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My brother entreated her to give him intelligence
of his sister and Zoraida, and learned
that they were both in the castle, but, according
to Thiuli&rsquo;s custom, had received different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
names; they were now called Mirza and Nurmahal.
When Fatima, the rescued slave, saw
that my brother was so cast down by this failure
of his enterprise, she bade him take courage,
and promised to show him means whereby
he could still deliver both the maidens. Aroused
by this thought, Mustapha was filled with
new hope, and besought her to point out to
him the way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only five months,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;have I been
Thiuli&rsquo;s slave; nevertheless, from the first, I
have been continually meditating an escape;
but for myself alone it was too difficult. In
the inner court of the castle, you may have
observed a fountain, which pours forth water
from ten tubes; this fountain riveted my
attention. I remembered in my father&rsquo;s house
to have seen a similar one, the water of
which was led up through a spacious aqueduct.
In order to learn whether this fountain was
constructed in the same manner, I one day
praised its magnificence to Thiuli, and inquired
after its architect. &lsquo;I myself built it,&rsquo;
answered he, &lsquo;and what thou seest here is still
the smallest part; for the water comes hither
into it from a brook at least a thousand paces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
off, flowing through a vaulted aqueduct, which
is as high as a man. And all this have I myself
planned.&rsquo; After hearing this, I often wished
only for a moment to have a man&rsquo;s strength,
in order to roll away the stone from the side
of the fountain; then could I have fled whither
I would. The aqueduct now will I show to
you; through it you can enter the castle by
night, and set them free. Only you must have
at least two men with you, in order to overpower
the slaves which, by night, guard the
seraglio.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus she spoke, and my brother Mustapha,
although twice disappointed already in his expectations,
once again took courage, and hoped
with Allah&rsquo;s assistance to carry out the plan
of the slave. He promised to conduct her in
safety to her native land, if she would assist
him in entering the castle. But one thought
still troubled him, namely, where he could find
two or three faithful assistants. Thereupon
the dagger of Orbasan occurred to him, and
the promise of the robber to hasten to his assistance,
when he should stand in need of help,
and he therefore started with Fatima from the
burying-ground, to seek the chieftain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span>
In the same city where he had converted
himself into a physician, with his last money
he purchased a horse, and procured lodgings
for Fatima, with a poor woman in the suburbs.
He, however, hastened towards the mountain
where he had first met Orbasan, and reached
it in three days. He soon found the tent, and
unexpectedly walked in before the chieftain,
who welcomed him with friendly courtesy.
He related to him his unsuccessful attempts,
whereupon the grave Orbasan could not restrain
himself from laughing a little now and
then, particularly when he announced himself
as the physician Chakamankabudibaba. At
the treachery of the little man, however, he
was furious; and swore, if he could find him,
to hang him with his own hand. He assured
my brother that he was ready to assist him the
moment he should be sufficiently recovered
from his ride. Accordingly, Mustapha remained
that night again in the robber&rsquo;s tent, and
with the first morning-red they set out, Orbasan
taking with him three of his bravest men,
well mounted and armed. They rode rapidly,
and in two days arrived at the little city, where
Mustapha had left the rescued Fatima. Thence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg&nbsp;134]</a></span>
they rode on with her unto the forest, from
which, at a little distance, they could see Thiuli&rsquo;s
castle; there they concealed themselves, to
await the night. As soon as it was dark, guided
by Fatima, they proceeded softly to the brook,
where the aqueduct commenced, and soon
found it. There they left Fatima and a servant
with the horses, and prepared themselves
for the descent: before they started, however,
Fatima once more repeated, with precision,
the directions she had given; namely, that, on
emerging from the fountain into the inner
court-yard, they would find a tower in each
corner on the right and left; that inside the
sixth gate from the right tower, they would
find Fatima and Zoraida, guarded by two black
slaves. Well provided with weapons and iron
implements for forcing the doors, Mustapha,
Orbasan, and the two other men, descended
through the aqueduct; they sank, indeed, in
water, up to the middle, but not the less vigorously
on that account did they press forward.</p>

<p>In a half hour they arrived at the fountain,
and immediately began to ply their tools. The
wall was thick and firm, but could not long
resist the united strength of the four men; they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
soon made a breach sufficiently large to allow
them to slip through without difficulty. Orbasan
was the first to emerge, and then assisted
the others. Being now all in the court-yard,
they examined the side of the castle which lay
before them, in order to find the door which
had been described. But they could not agree
as to which it was, for on counting from the
right tower to the left, they found one door
which had been walled up, and they knew not
whether Fatima had included this in her calculation.
But Orbasan was not long in making
up his mind: &ldquo;My good sword will open to
me this gate,&rdquo; he exclaimed, advancing to the
sixth, while the others followed him. They
opened it, and found six black slaves lying
asleep upon the floor; imagining that they had
missed the object of their search, they were
already softly drawing back, when a figure
raised itself in the corner, and in well-known
accents called for help. It was the little man
of the robber-encampment. But ere the slaves
knew what had taken place, Orbasan sprang
upon the little man, tore his girdle in two,
stopped his mouth, and bound his hands behind
his back; then he turned to the slaves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>
some of whom were already half bound by
Mustapha and the two others, and assisted in
completely overpowering them. They presented
their daggers to the breasts of the slaves,
and asked where Nurmahal and Mirza were:
they confessed that they were in the next
chamber. Mustapha rushed into the room,
and found Fatima and Zoraida awakened by
the noise. They were not long in collecting
their jewels and garments, and following my
brother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two robbers proposed to Orbasan
to carry off what they could find, but
he forbade them, saying: &ldquo;It shall never be
told of Orbasan, that he enters houses by night,
to steal gold.&rdquo; Mustapha, and those he had
preserved, quickly stepped into the aqueduct,
whither Orbasan promised to follow them immediately.
As soon as they had departed, the
chieftain and one of the robbers led forth the
little man into the court-yard; there, having
fastened around his neck a silken cord, which
they had brought for that purpose, they hung
him on the highest point of the fountain. After
having thus punished the treachery of the
wretch, they also entered the aqueduct, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg&nbsp;137]</a></span>
followed Mustapha. With tears the two maidens
thanked their brave preserver, Orbasan;
but he urged them in haste to their flight, for
it was very probable that Thiuli-Kos would
seek them in every direction.</p>

<p>With deep emotion, on the next day, did
Mustapha and the rescued maidens part with
Orbasan. Indeed, they never will forget him!
Fatima, the freed slave, left us in disguise for
Balsora, in order to take passage thence to her
native land.</p>

<p>After a short and agreeable journey, my
brother and his companions reached home.
Delight at seeing them once more, almost killed
my old father; the next day after their arrival,
he gave a great festival, to which all the city
was invited. Before a large assemblage of
relations and friends, my brother had to relate
his story, and with one voice they praised him
and the noble robber.</p>

<p>When, however, Mustapha had finished, my
father arose and led Zoraida to him. &ldquo;Thus
remove I,&rdquo; said he with solemn voice, &ldquo;the
curse from thy head; take this maiden as the
reward which thy unwearied courage has
merited. Receive my fatherly blessing: and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg&nbsp;138]</a></span>
may there never be wanting to our city, men
who, in brotherly love, in prudence, and bravery,
may be thy equals!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Caravan had reached the end of the
desert, and gladly did the travellers salute the
green meadows, and thickly-leaved trees, of
whose charms they had been deprived for so
many days. In a lovely valley lay a caravansery,
which they selected as their resting-place
for the night; and though it offered but limited
accommodations and refreshment, still was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg&nbsp;139]</a></span>
whole company more happy and sociable than
ever: for the thought of having passed through
the dangers and hardships, with which a journey
through the desert is ever accompanied,
had opened every heart, and attuned their
minds to jest and gayety. Muley, the young
and merry merchant, went through a comic
dance, and sang songs thereto, which elicited
a laugh, even from Zaleukos, the serious Greek.
But not content with having raised the spirits
of his comrades by dance and merriment, he
also gave them, in the best style, the story he
had promised, and, as soon as he could recover
breath from his gambols, began the following
tale.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg&nbsp;140]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/tosb12.png" width="600" height="420"
alt="Decorative title, LITTLE MUCK" />
</div>


<p><span class="dropcapilrg"><span class="dropcap">I</span></span>N Nicea, my beloved father-city,
lived a man,
whom people called &ldquo;Little
Muck.&rdquo; Though at
that time I was quite
young, I can recollect him
very well, particularly
since, on one occasion, I was
flogged almost to death, by my
father, on his account. The
Little Muck, even then, when I
knew him, an old man, was nevertheless
but three or four feet high:
he had a singular figure, for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg&nbsp;141]</a></span>
body, little and smart as it was, carried a head
much larger and thicker than that of others.
He lived all alone in a large house, and even
cooked for himself; moreover, it would not
have been known in the city whether he was
alive or dead, (for he went forth but once in
four weeks,) had not every day, about the
hour of noon, strong fumes come forth from
the house. Nevertheless, in the evening he
was often to be seen walking to and fro upon
his roof; although, from the street, it seemed
as if it were his head alone that was running
around there.</p>

<p>I and my comrades were wicked fellows,
who teased and ridiculed every one; accordingly,
to us it was a holiday when the Little
Muck went forth: on the appointed day we
would assemble before his house, and wait for
him to come out. When, then, the door opened,
and at first the immense head and still
larger turban peered forth, when the rest of
the body followed covered with a small cloak
which had been irregularly curtailed, with
wide pantaloons, and a broad girdle in which
hung a long dagger, so long that one could not
tell whether Muck was fastened to the dagger,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg&nbsp;142]</a></span>
or the dagger to Muck&mdash;when in this guise he
came forth, then would the air resound with
our cries of joy; then would we fling our caps
aloft, and dance round him, like mad. Little
Muck, however, would salute us with a serious
bow, and walk with long strides through the
street, shuffling now and then his feet, for he
wore large wide slippers, such as I have never
elsewhere seen. We boys would run behind
him, crying continually, &ldquo;Little Muck! Little
Muck!&rdquo; We also had a droll little verse,
which we would now and then sing in his
honor; it ran thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;Little Muck, oh Little Muck!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">What a fine, brave dwarf art thou!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Livest in a house so tall;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Goest forth but once a month,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mountain-headed, though so small.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Turn thyself but once, and look!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Run, and catch us, Little Muck.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In this way had we often carried on our
sport, and, to my shame, I must confess that I
took the most wicked part in it, for I often
plucked him by the mantle, and once trod
from behind on his large slippers, so that
he fell down. This was, at first, a source of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg&nbsp;143]</a></span>
the greatest amusement to me, but my laughter
soon ceased when I saw the Little Muck go
up to my father&rsquo;s house; he walked straight
in, and remained there some time. I concealed
myself near the door, and saw Muck come
forth again, escorted by my father, who respectfully
shook his hand, and with many bows
parted with him at the door. My mind was
uneasy, and I remained some time in my concealment;
at length, however, hunger, which
I feared more than blows, drove me in, and
ashamed and with downcast head, I walked
in before my father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou hast, as I hear, insulted the good
Muck,&rdquo; said he with a very serious tone. &ldquo;I
will tell thee the history of this Muck, and
then I am sure thou wilt ridicule him no more.
But first, thou shalt receive thy allowance.&rdquo;
The allowance was five-and-twenty lashes,
which he took care to count only too honestly.
He thereupon took a long pipe-stem, unscrewed
the amber mouthpiece, and beat me more severely
than he had ever done before.</p>

<p>When the five-and-twenty were all made up,
he commanded me to attend, and told me the
following story of Little Muck.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg&nbsp;144]</a></span>
The father of Little Muck, who is properly
called Mukrah, lived here in Nicea, a respectable,
but poor man. He kept himself almost as
retired as his son does now. The latter he
could not endure, because he was ashamed of
his dwarfish figure, and let him therefore grow
up in perfect ignorance. When the Little
Muck was still in his seventeenth year, a
merry child, his father, a grave man, kept continually
reproaching him, that he, who ought
long before to have trodden down the shoes of
infancy, was still so stupid and childish.</p>

<p>The old man, however, one day had a bad
fall, from the effects of which he died, and
Little Muck was left behind, poor and ignorant.
His cruel relations, to whom the deceased
owed more than he could pay, turned
the poor fellow out of the house, and advised
him to go forth into the world, and seek his
fortune. Muck answered that he was all
ready, only asking them for his father&rsquo;s dress,
which they willingly granted him. His father
had been a large, portly man, and the garments
on that account did not fit him. Muck, however,
soon hit upon an expedient; he cut off
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg&nbsp;145]</a></span>
what was too long, and then put them on. He
seemed, however, to have forgotten that he
must also take from their width; hence the
strange dress that he wears at the present
day; the huge turban, the broad girdle, the
wide breeches, the blue cloak, all these he has
inherited from his father, and worn ever since.
The long Damascus dagger of his father, too,
he attached to his girdle, and seizing a little
staff, set out from the door.</p>

<p>Gayly he wandered, the whole day, for he
had set out to seek his fortune: if he saw upon
the ground a potsherd shining in the sunlight,
he took care to pick it up, in the belief that he
could change it into a diamond of the first
water; if he saw in the distance the cupola of
a Mosque sparkling like fire, or the sea glittering
like a mirror, he would hasten up, fully
persuaded that he had arrived at fairy-land.
But ah! these phantoms vanished as he approached,
and too soon fatigue, and his stomach
gnawed by hunger, convinced him that he was
still in the land of mortals. In this way he
travelled two days, in hunger and grief, and
despaired of finding his fortune; the produce
of the field was his only support, the hard earth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
his bed. On the morning of the third day, he
espied a large city upon an eminence. Brightly
shone the crescent upon her pinnacles, variegated
flags waved over the roofs, and seemed
to be beckoning Little Muck to themselves.
In surprise he stood still, contemplating the
city and the surrounding country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There at length will Klein-Muck find his
fortune,&rdquo; said he to himself, and in spite of his
fatigue bounded in the air; &ldquo;there or nowhere!&rdquo;
He collected all his strength, and walked towards
the city. But although the latter seemed
quite near, he could not reach it until mid-day,
for his little limbs almost entirely refused
him their assistance, and he was obliged to sit
down to rest in the shade of a palm-tree. At
last he reached the gate; he fixed the mantle
jauntily, wound the turban still more tastily
around his head, made the girdle broader, and
arranged the dagger so as to fall still more obliquely:
then, wiping the dust from his shoes,
and seizing his cane, he marched bravely
through the gate.</p>

<p>He had already wandered through a few
streets, but nowhere did any door open to him,
nowhere did any one exclaim, as he had anticipated:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
&ldquo;Little Muck, come in and eat and
drink, and rest thy little feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was looking very wistfully straight at a
large fine house, when a window opened, and
an old woman, putting out her head, exclaimed
in a singing tone&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&ldquo;Hither, come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The porridge is here;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The table I&rsquo;ve spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Come taste of my cheer.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Hither, come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The porridge is hot;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Your neighbors bring with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To dip in the pot!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The door opened, and Muck saw many dogs
and cats walking in. For a moment he stood
in doubt whether he should accept the invitation;
at last, however, he took heart and entered
the mansion. Before him proceeded a
couple of genteel kittens, and he resolved to
follow them, since they, perhaps, knew the way
to the kitchen better than himself.</p>

<p>When Muck had ascended the steps, he met
the same old woman who had looked forth
from the window. With frowning air she
asked what he wanted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg&nbsp;148]</a></span>
&ldquo;Thou hast invited every one to thy porridge,&rdquo;
answered Little Muck, &ldquo;and as I was
very hungry, I came too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old woman laughed, saying, &ldquo;Whence
come you then, strange fellow? The whole
city knows that I cook for no one but my dear
cats, and now and then, as you see, I invite
their companions from the neighborhood.&rdquo;
Little Muck told her how hard it had gone
with him since his father&rsquo;s death, and entreated
her to let him dine, that day, with her cats.
The old woman, on whom the frank relation
of the little fellow made quite an impression,
permitted him to become her guest, and gave
him abundance to eat and drink. When he
was satisfied and refreshed, she looked at him
for some time, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little Muck, remain with me in my service;
you will have little to do, and shall be
well taken care of.&rdquo; Muck, who had relished
the cat-porridge, agreed, and thus became the
servant of the Frau Ahavzi. His duties were
light but singular: Frau Ahavzi had two male,
and four female cats; every morning Little
Muck had to comb their hair, and anoint them
with costly ointment. When the Frau went
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
out, he had to give them all his attention;
when they ate, he placed their bowls before
them; and, at night, he had to lay them on
silken cushions, and wrap them up in velvet
coverings. There were, moreover, a few little
dogs in the house, on which he was obliged to
wait; but there were not so many ceremonies
gone through with these as with the cats,
whom Frau Ahavzi treated as her own children.
As for the rest, Muck led as retired a
life as in his father&rsquo;s house, for with the exception
of the Frau, he saw every day only
dogs and cats.</p>

<p>For a long time it went very well with Little
Muck; he had enough to eat, and but little
to do; and the old woman seemed to be perfectly
satisfied with him. But, by-and-by, the
cats began to behave very badly; the moment
the Frau went out, they ran around the rooms
as if possessed, threw down every thing in
confusion, and broke considerable fine crockery,
which stood in their way. When, however,
they heard their mistress coming up the
steps, they would creep to their cushions, and
wag their tails, when they saw her, as if nothing
had happened. The Frau Ahavzi always
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
fell in a passion when she saw her rooms so
disordered, and attributed all to Muck; assert
his innocence as he might, she believed her
cats who looked so demure, in preference to
her servant.</p>

<p>Little Muck was very sorry that here also
he had been disappointed in finding his fortune,
and determined in his own mind to leave the
service of the Frau Ahavzi. As, however, on
his first journey, he had learned how badly one
lives without money, he resolved to procure,
in some way, for himself the wages which his
mistress had once promised him, but had never
paid. In the house of the Frau Ahavzi was a
room, which was always closed, and the inside
of which he had never seen. Nevertheless, he
had often heard the Frau making a noise
therein, and he would have willingly risked
his life to know what was there concealed.
Reflecting upon his travelling-money, it occurred
to him that there his mistress might
conceal her treasures. But the door was always
tightly closed, and therefore he could not
get at them.</p>

<p>One morning, after the Frau Ahavzi had
gone out, one of the little dogs who was treated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
by her in a very stepmother-like manner, but
whose favor he had in a great degree gained
by various acts of kindness, pulled him by his
wide pantaloons, and acted as if he wanted
Muck to follow him. Muck, who always gladly
played with him, did so, and perceived that
the dog was leading him to the sleeping apartment
of his mistress; he stopped before a door,
which the little fellow had never before observed,
and which was now wide open. The
dog entered, and Muck, following, was overjoyed
at finding himself in the very chamber,
which had so long been the object of his curiosity.
He looked all around for money, but could
find none: old garments only, and strangely-fashioned
vases were scattered around. One
of the latter, in particular, attracted his attention;
it was of crystal, and fine figures were
cut thereon. He lifted it up and turned it on
all sides; but, oh horror! he had not observed
that it had a lid, which was but insecurely fastened
on: it fell to the floor, and broke into a
thousand pieces.</p>

<p>For a long time stood Little Muck motionless
through terror; now was his fate decided, now
must he fly, or be killed by the old woman.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg&nbsp;152]</a></span>
His departure was immediately resolved on;
he only looked around, to see if he could not
use some of the goods of the Frau Ahavzi upon
his journey. Thereupon, a formidable pair of
huge slippers met his eye; they were not, it is
true, beautiful, but his own could hold out no
longer; moreover their size was an inducement,
for when he had these upon his feet,
people would see, he hoped, that he had cast
off the shoes of childhood. He quickly took
off his own slippers, and put on the others.
A walking-stick, also, with a fine lion&rsquo;s head
cut upon the handle, seemed to be standing too
idly in the corner; so he seized it, and hurried
from the apartment. He hastened to his own
room, put on his cloak, arranged his paternal
turban, placed the dagger in his girdle, and
ran as fast as his feet would carry him, out of
the house, and out of the city. Fear of his old
mistress drove him farther and still farther,
until, from fatigue, he could scarcely run any
more. He had never gone so quickly in his
life; nay, it appeared to him as if he could not
cease running, for an invisible power seemed
propelling him on. At last he observed that
this must be connected with the slippers, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg&nbsp;153]</a></span>
they would continually shoot forward and bear
him along with them. He endeavored in various
ways, to stand still, but could not succeed;
at last, in the greatest distress, he cried
out to himself, as a man calls to his horse,
&ldquo;Wo&mdash;wo!&rdquo; Then the slippers stopped, and
Muck fell exhausted upon the earth.</p>

<p>The slippers were a source of great joy to
him. Thus had he, by his services, gained
something that would help him on his way
through the world to seek his fortune. In spite
of his joy, he fell asleep through fatigue; for
the body of Little Muck, which had to carry so
heavy a head, could not hold out long. In his
dream the little dog appeared to him, which
had assisted him to the slippers in the house of
the Frau Ahavzi, and thus spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Muck, thou dost not still rightly understand
the use of the slippers: know that if,
in them, thou turnest thyself three times around
upon the heel, thou canst fly wherever thou
wilt; and with the staff thou canst find treasures,
for, wherever gold is buried, it will beat
three times upon the earth; where silver,
twice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus dreamed Little Muck. When he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg&nbsp;154]</a></span>
awoke, he reflected on the singular vision, and
resolved to make the experiment immediately.
He put on the slippers, lifted one foot, and began
to turn around upon his heel. But whoever
has attempted to perform this man&oelig;uvre
in an enormously wide slipper, will not wonder
that the Little Muck could not succeed,
particularly when he remembers that his
heavy head kept falling on this side and on
that.</p>

<p>The poor little fellow fell several times violently
upon his nose; nevertheless, that did not
deter him from making the trial again, and at
last he succeeded. Like a wheel he went
around upon his heel, wishing himself in the
nearest large city, and&mdash;the slippers mounted
into the air, ran with the speed of the wind
through the clouds, and before Little Muck
knew what to make of it, he found himself in
a large market-place, where many stalls were
erected, and innumerable men were busily
running to and fro. He moved among the
people, but considered it more prudent to retire
into a less frequented street, for near the
market one of the slippers bore him along so
rapidly, that he almost fell down, or else ran
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg&nbsp;155]</a></span>
against one and another with his projecting
dagger, so that it was with difficulty he avoided
their blows.</p>

<p>Little Muck now seriously reflected what
he should set about, in order to earn a piece of
money. He had, it is true, a staff which would
show him concealed treasures, but how could
he find a place where gold or silver was buried.
He could, indeed, in this emergency, have exhibited
himself for money, but for this he was
too proud. At last the quickness of his gait
occurred to him. Perhaps, thought he, my
slippers can procure me support, and he determined
to hire himself out as a courier. He
ventured to hope that the king of the city rewarded
such service well, so he inquired for
the palace. Before the door of the palace stood
a guard, who asked him what he sought there.
On answering that he was in search of service,
they led him to the overseer of the slaves.
Before this one he laid his request, and entreated
that he might be admitted among the
royal couriers. The overseer measured him
with his eyes from head to foot, and said:
&ldquo;How! with thy little feet, which are scarcely
a span long, wishest thou to become a royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg&nbsp;156]</a></span>
messenger? Away with thee! I cannot play
with every fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Muck assured him, however, that his
proposal was made in perfect seriousness, and
that he would let it come to a trial with the
swiftest, upon a wager. The matter seemed
very ludicrous to the overseer. He commanded
him to hold himself in readiness for a
race in the afternoon, and leading him into
the kitchen, saw that he was furnished with
proper meat and drink. He himself, however,
repaired unto the king, and told him of the
little man and his proposal. The king was a
merry lord, and therefore it pleased him well
that the overseer had kept the little man for
their amusement. He directed him to make
preparations in a large meadow behind the
castle, that the race might be conveniently beheld
by his whole court, and once more commanded
him to take great care of the dwarf.
The king told his princes, and princesses, what
a pastime they were to enjoy that afternoon;
these told it again to their attendants, and
when the time arrived all were in great expectation;
and as many as had feet poured into
the meadow, where a scaffolding had been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg&nbsp;157]</a></span>
erected, in order to see the boastful dwarf
run.</p>

<p>As soon as the king and his sons and
daughters had taken their places upon the
platform, the Little Muck walked forth upon
the meadow, and made before the noble sovereign
a very elegant bow. A universal cry of
joy arose, the moment they beheld the little
fellow; such a figure had they never seen.
The small body with the mighty head, the little
cloak, and the wide pantaloons, the long dagger
in the broad girdle, the tiny feet in the immense
slippers&mdash;no! it was so droll a sight they could
not keep from laughing aloud. Little Muck,
however, was not disconcerted by their laughter.
He proudly walked forward, supported by
his cane, and awaited his opponent. At Muck&rsquo;s
own desire, the overseer of the slaves had selected
the best runner. Walking in, he placed
himself near the dwarf, and both looked for the
signal. Thereupon the Princess Amarza made
a sign with her veil as had been preconcerted,
and, like two arrows shot from the same bow,
the racers flew over the meadow.</p>

<p>At first the courier took a tremendous bound,
but Muck pursued him in his slipper carriage,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg&nbsp;158]</a></span>
overtook him, passed him, and had been standing
for some time at the goal, when his opponent,
gasping for breath, ran up. Amazement
for a few moments enchained the spectators:
the king was the first to clap his hands; then
shouted the crowd for joy, all exclaiming,
&ldquo;Long live the Little Muck, the victor in the
race!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile they had brought up the little
man; he prostrated himself before the king,
saying, &ldquo;Most mighty King, I have here given
thee but a small proof of my powers; allow
them, I pray thee, to give me a place
among thy couriers.&rdquo; The king answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear Muck, thou shalt be my favorite
messenger, and shalt remain about my person;
every year shalt thou have a hundred gold
pieces as thy wages, and thou shalt sup at the
table of my first attendant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Muck thought he had at last found
the fortune, of which he had so long been in
search, and was merry and light-hearted.
Moreover, he rejoiced in the peculiar favor of
the king, for the latter employed him on his
quickest and most secret errands, which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
performed with the greatest care, and with inconceivable
rapidity.</p>

<p>But the other attendants of the king were
not well affected towards him, because they
reluctantly saw themselves displaced from their
lord&rsquo;s favor by a dwarf, who knew how to do
nothing, but to run fast. They set on foot many
a conspiracy against him in order to work his
destruction, but all failed, through the confidence
which the king placed in his private
Oberleibl&auml;ufer, (for to this dignity had he in so
short a time arrived.)</p>

<p>Muck, upon whom these movements against
himself produced no effect, thought not of revenge;
for that he had too good a heart: no,
he reflected upon the means of making himself
necessary to his enemies, and beloved by them.
Thereupon the staff, which in his good fortune
he had forgotten, occurred to him; if he could
find treasures, he thought the lords would be
more favorably disposed towards him. He had
before this often heard that the father of the
present king had buried much of his gold,
when the enemy had invaded the land; they
said, moreover, that he had died without imparting
the secret to his son. From this time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
Muck always carried his cane, in the hope
that he would some time pass over the place
where the money of the old king was buried.</p>

<p>One evening, chance led him into a remote
portion of the castle-garden, which he seldom
visited, when suddenly he felt the staff move
in his hand, and three times it beat upon the
ground. He knew in an instant what this indicated;
accordingly he drew forth his dagger,
made marks on the surrounding trees, and
then slipped back into the castle. Then he
procured a spade, and awaited night for his
undertaking.</p>

<p>Treasure-digging, however, gave Muck more
trouble than he had anticipated. His arms
were very feeble, his spade large and heavy;
he might perhaps have been laboring a couple
of hours, without getting any farther down
than as many feet. At length he hit upon
something hard, which sounded like iron: he
then set to work still more diligently, and soon
brought up a large cover; he then descended
into the hole, in order to examine what the
cover concealed, and found a large pot completely
full of gold pieces. His feeble wisdom,
however, did not teach him to lift up the pot;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
but he put in his pantaloons and girdle as
much as he could carry, filled his cloak, and
then carefully covering up the rest, placed the
load upon his back. But, indeed, if he had not
had the slippers on his feet, he could not have
stirred, so heavily did the gold weigh him
down. Then, unobserved, he reached his
room, and secured the money under the cushions
of his sofa.</p>

<p>When the little man saw so much gold in
his possession, he thought the tables would now
be turned, and that from among his enemies at
court, he could gain many well-wishers and
warm friends. But even in this, one could see
that the good Muck had enjoyed no very careful
education; otherwise he would not have
imagined that he could buy true friends with
gold. Ah! that he had then put on his slippers,
and with his mantle full of gold, scampered
away!</p>

<p>The gold which from this time Little Muck
distributed with lavish hand, awakened the
envy of the other court-attendants. The
kitchen-master, Ahuli, said, &ldquo;He is a counterfeiter.&rdquo;
The slave-overseer, Achmet, said,
&ldquo;He has cajoled the king.&rdquo; But Archaz, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
treasurer, his most wicked enemy, who himself,
even, now and then put his hand into his
lord&rsquo;s coffers, exclaimed, &ldquo;He is a thief.&rdquo; In
order to be sure of the thing, they consulted
together, and the head cup-bearer, Korchuz,
placed himself one day, with a very sorrowful
and depressed air, before the eyes of the king.
He made his wo so apparent, that the king
asked him what was the matter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;I am sorry that I have
lost the favor of my lord!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why talkest thou idly, friend Korchuz?&rdquo;
rejoined the monarch. &ldquo;Since when have I
veiled from thee the sun of my favor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cup-bearer answered, that he loaded
his private Oberleibl&auml;ufer with money, but gave
his poor faithful servants nothing. The king
was much astonished at this accusation, had
the story of Muck&rsquo;s gold-distribution told him,
and the conspirators soon aroused in him the
suspicion that the dwarf had, in some way or
other, stolen the money from the treasure-chamber.
Very pleasant was this turn of the
matter to the treasurer, who would not otherwise
have willingly submitted his accounts to
examination. The king thereupon commanded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg&nbsp;163]</a></span>
that they should secretly watch all the
movements of the dwarf, in order, if possible,
to surprise him in the act. When, now, on the
night which followed the fatal day, seeing his
funds almost exhausted by his generosity,
Muck crept forth, with his spade, into the
castle-garden, to bring new supplies from his
secret treasury, the watch followed him in
the distance, led by Ahuli and Archaz; and, at
the moment when he was removing the gold
from the pot to his cloak, they fell upon him,
bound him, and immediately led him before
the king. The latter, whom, independently of
any thing else, this interruption of his sleep
would have enraged, received his poor dwarf
very ungraciously, and ordered an immediate
trial. Meanwhile they had dug the full pot
out of the ground, and with the spade and
cloak full of gold had placed it before the king.
The treasurer said that he had surprised Muck
with his guard, just as he had buried this vessel
of gold in the earth.</p>

<p>The king thereupon inquired of the accused,
whether it was true, and whence the gold had
come.</p>

<p>Little Muck, conscious of innocence,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
answered that he had discovered this pot in the
garden; that he had not buried it, but had
brought it to light.</p>

<p>All present laughed aloud at this defence;
the king, however, provoked in the highest degree
by the supposed impudence of the dwarf,
exclaimed, &ldquo;How, wretch! wilt thou so stupidly
and shamelessly lie to thy king, after
having stolen from him? Treasurer Archaz,
I command thee to say whether thou knowest
this sum of gold to be the same that is missing
from my treasury.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The treasurer thereupon answered that he
was sure of the thing; that so much and even
more had been missing from the royal treasures;
and he could take his oath that this was
the stolen money. Then the king commanded
them to place Little Muck in galling chains,
and convey him to prison: to Archaz, however,
he gave the gold, that he might restore
it to the treasury. Delighted at the fortunate
issue of the matter, the officer took it, and
counted out, at home, the glittering gold pieces;
but the bad man never disclosed that down
in the pot lay a letter, to the following purport:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
&ldquo;The enemy has overrun my land; therefore
I here conceal a portion of my treasure.
Whoever may find it, the curse of his king
fall upon him, if he do not immediately deliver
it to my son!</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">King Sadi.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>In his dungeon, poor Muck gave way to
sorrowful reflections; he knew that for taking
royal property death was the penalty; and yet&mdash;he
could not betray the secret of his staff
unto the king, because, in that case, he justly
feared being deprived of both that, and his slippers.
His slippers, alas! could render him no
help, for there by close fetters he was fastened
to the wall, and, torment himself as he might,
he could not turn around upon his heel. When,
however, on the next day, sentence of death
was pronounced, he thought it would be better
to live without the magic staff, than to die with
it; and, having asked a private audience with
the king, disclosed to him the secret. At
first the king gave no credit to his assertions,
but Little Muck promised him a proof, if he
would respite him from death. The king gave
him his word upon it, and having had some
gold buried in the earth, unseen by Muck,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
commanded him to find it with his cane. In
a few moments he succeeded in doing so, for
the staff beat three times distinctly upon the
ground. Then the king saw that his treasurer
had betrayed him, and sent him, as is customary
in the East, a silken cord, wherewith he should
strangle himself. To Little Muck, however,
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have indeed promised thee thy life, but it
seems to me that this is not the only secret
thou art possessed of, connected with this staff.
Therefore thou shalt remain in everlasting
captivity, if thou do not confess what relation
exists between it and thy rapid running.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Little Muck, whom one night in his dungeon
had deprived of all desire for further confinement,
acknowledged that his whole art lay
in the slippers; nevertheless, he informed not
the king of the wonderful effect of turning
three times upon the heel. The king put on
the slippers, himself, in order to make the experiment,
and ran, like mad, through the garden;
often did he wish to hold up, but he
knew not how to bring the slippers to a halt,
and Muck, who could not deny himself this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg&nbsp;167]</a></span>
revenge, let him run on, until he fell down exhausted.</p>

<p>When the king returned to consciousness,
he was terribly angry at Little Muck, who
had suffered him to run until so entirely out
of breath. &ldquo;I have promised thee thy freedom
and life,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but within twelve hours
must thou leave my land; otherwise will I
have thee hung.&rdquo; The slippers and cane, however,
he commanded them to bear to his treasure-chamber.</p>

<p>Thus, poor as ever, wandered the little fellow
forth through the land, cursing the folly which
had led him astray, and prevented his playing
an important part at court. The land from
which he was banished, was fortunately not
extensive, and accordingly eight hours brought
him to the frontier; but travelling, now that
he was used to his dear slippers, came very
hard to him. Having arrived at the border,
he chose the usual road for reaching the most
lonely part of the forest, for he hated all men,
and resolved to live there by himself. In a
thick portion of the wood, he lighted on a
place, which seemed to him quite suitable for
the resolution he had taken. A clear brook,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg&nbsp;168]</a></span>
surrounded by large shady fig-trees, and a soft
turf, invited him: he threw himself down, determined
to taste food no more, but calmly to
await his end. Amid his sorrowful reflections
on death, he fell asleep; when he awoke, he
was tormented by hunger, and began to think
that starving to death was rather an unpleasant
affair; so he looked around to find something
to eat.</p>

<p>Fine ripe figs hung upon the tree beneath
which he had slept; he stretched forth his
hand to pluck some; their taste was delicious,
and then he descended into the brook to slake
his thirst. But what was his horror, when the
water showed his head adorned with two immense
ears, and a long thick nose! Amazed,
he clapped his hands upon his ears, and they
were really more than half an ell long.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I deserve ass&rsquo;s ears!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;for,
like an ass, have I trodden Fortune under my
feet.&rdquo; He wandered around among the trees,
and feeling hunger again, was obliged to have
recourse once more to the fig-tree, for he could
find nothing else that was eatable. After the
second portion of figs, it struck him that if his
ears could find room beneath his large turban,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg&nbsp;169]</a></span>
he would not look so ridiculous, and, on trying
it, he found that his ears had vanished. He
ran straight back to the stream, in order to
convince himself thereof; it was actually so;
his ears had resumed their original figure, his
long misshapen nose was no more! He soon
perceived how all this had happened; from the
first fig-tree he had received the long nose and
ears, the second had relieved him of them: he
saw with joy that kind destiny yet again placed
in his hands the means of becoming fortunate.
He plucked, therefore, from each tree as many
figs as he could carry, and went back to the land
which shortly before he had left. There, in
the first town, he disguised himself by means
of different garments; then, turning again to
the city inhabited by the king, he soon arrived
at it.</p>

<p>For about a year ripe fruit had been quite
scarce; Little Muck, therefore, placed himself
before the gate of the palace, for from his
former residence there, it was well known to
him, that here such rareties would be purchased
by the kitchen-master for the royal
table. Muck had not long been seated, when
he saw that dignitary walking across the court-yard.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg&nbsp;170]</a></span>
He examined the articles of the traders
who had placed themselves at the palace-gate;
at length his eye fell upon Muck&rsquo;s
little basket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! a dainty morsel!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which
will certainly please his majesty: what wish
you for the whole basket?&rdquo; Muck set a high
price upon them, and the bargain was soon
struck. The kitchen-master gave the basket
to his slave, and went his way: meantime
Little Muck stole away, for he feared, when
the change should show itself on the heads of
the court, that he, as the one who sold them,
would be sought for punishment.</p>

<p>At table the king was well pleased, and
praised his kitchen-master more than ever, on
account of his good kitchen, and the care with
which he always sought the rarest morsels for
his table; the officer, however, who well
knew what dainties he had in the back-ground,
smiled pleasantly, and let fall but few words:
&ldquo;The day is not all past till evening,&rdquo; or &ldquo;End
good, all good;&rdquo; so that the princesses were
very curious to know what he would still bring
on. The moment, however, he had the fine,
inviting figs set upon the table, a universal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg&nbsp;171]</a></span>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; escaped the lips of those who were
present. &ldquo;How ripe! how delicate!&rdquo; exclaimed
the king; &ldquo;kitchen-master, thou art
a whole-souled man, and deservest our peculiar
favor!&rdquo; Thus speaking, the king, who with
such choice dishes took care to be very sparing,
with his own hands distributed the figs
around the table. Each prince and princess
received two; the ladies of the court, the
Viziers and Agas, each one; the rest he placed
before himself, and began to swallow them
with great delight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the name of heaven, father, why lookest
thou so strange?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed the
Princess Amarza. All gazed in astonishment
upon the king; vast ears hung down from
his head, a long nose stretched itself bridge-like,
over above his chin; upon themselves
also they looked, one upon another, with
amazement and horror; all, more or less,
were adorned with the same strange headdress.</p>

<p>The horror of the court may be imagined.
All the physicians in the city were immediately
sent for; they came with a blustering
air, prescribed pills and mixtures, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg&nbsp;172]</a></span>
ears and noses remained. They operated on
one of the princes, but the ears grew out
again.</p>

<p>From the place of concealment into which
he had withdrawn, Muck had heard the whole
story, and perceived that it was now time
for him to commence operations. He had
already, with the money obtained by the sale
of his figs, procured a dress which would represent
him as a learned man; a long beard of
goat&rsquo;s hair completed the illusion. With a
small sack full of figs he repaired to the royal
palace, and offered his assistance as a foreign
physician. At first they were quite incredulous;
but when Little Muck gave a fig to one
of the princes, and thereby restored ears and
nose to their original shape, then were all
eager to be cured by the stranger. But the
king took him silently by the hand, and led
him to his apartment; then, opening a door
that led into the treasure-chamber, he made
signs to Muck to follow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here are my treasures,&rdquo; said the king;
&ldquo;choose for thyself: whatever it may be, it
shall be thine, if thou wilt free me from this
shameful evil.&rdquo; This was sweet music in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg&nbsp;173]</a></span>
ears of Little Muck: at the moment of entering
he had seen his slippers standing upon the
floor, and hard by lay his little staff. He
moved around the room, as if in wonder at
the royal treasures; but no sooner had he
reached his beloved shoes, than he hastily
slipped into them, and seizing the little cane,
tore off his false beard, and displayed to the
astonished king the well-known countenance
of his exiled Muck.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/tosb13.png" width="400" height="316"
alt="A man, with a long nose and ears (almost resembling a donkey), is running, arms
raised above his head" />
</div>

<p>&ldquo;False king!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who rewardest
faithful service with ingratitude, take, as well-deserved
punishment, the deformity which
thou now hast. The ears I leave thee, that,
each day they may remind thee of Little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg&nbsp;174]</a></span>
Muck.&rdquo; Having thus spoken, he turned quickly
around upon his heel, wished himself far
away, and before the king could call for help
Little Muck had vanished. Ever since, he
has lived here in great affluence, but alone,
for men he despises. Experience has made
him a wise man&mdash;one who, though there is
something offensive in his exterior, deserves
rather your admiration than your ridicule.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Such was my father&rsquo;s story. I assured him
that I sincerely repented of my behavior towards
the good little man, and he remitted the
other half of the punishment which he had intended
for me. To my comrades I told the
wonderful history of the dwarf, and we conceived
such an affection for him, that no
one insulted him any more. On the contrary,
we honored him as long as he lived, and
bowed as low to him as to Cadi or Mufti.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The travellers determined to rest a day in
this caravansery, in order to refresh themselves
and their beasts for the rest of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg&nbsp;175]</a></span>
journey. The gayety of the day before again
prevailed, and they diverted themselves with
various sports. After the meal, however, they
called upon the fifth merchant, Ali Sizah, to
perform his duty to the rest, and give them a
story. He answered, that his life was too poor
in remarkable adventures for him to relate one
connected therewith, but he would tell them
something which had no relation to it: &ldquo;The
story of the False Prince.&rdquo;</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

</div>


<p><span class="dropcaptlrg"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HERE was once an honest
journeyman tailor, by name
Labakan, who learned his
trade with an excellent
master in Alexandria. It
could not be said that Labakan
was unhandy with
the needle; on the contrary,
he could make excellent work:
moreover, one would have done
him injustice to have called him
lazy. Nevertheless, his companions
knew not what to make of him, for
he would often sew for hours
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
together so rapidly that the needle would glow
in his hand, and the thread smoke, and that
none could equal him. At another time, however,
(and this, alas! happened more frequently,)
he would sit in deep meditation, looking
with his staring eyes straight before him, and
with a countenance and air so peculiar, that
his master and fellow-journeymen could say of
his appearance nothing else than, &ldquo;Labakan
has on again, his aristocratic face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Friday, however, when others quietly
returned home from prayers to their labor,
Labakan would come forth from the mosque
in a fine garment which with great pains he
had made for himself, and walk with slow and
haughty steps through the squares and streets
of the city. At such times, if one of his companions
cried, &ldquo;Joy be with thee!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;How
goes it, friend Labakan?&rdquo; he would patronizingly
give a token of recognition with his
hand, or, if he felt called upon to be very
polite, would bow genteelly with the head.
Whenever his master said to him in jest, &ldquo;Labakan,
in thee a prince is lost,&rdquo; he would be
rejoiced, and answer, &ldquo;Have you too observed
it?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;I have already long thought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
In this manner did the honest journeyman
tailor conduct himself for a long time, while
his master tolerated his folly, because, in other
respects, he was a good man and an excellent
workman. But one day, Selim, the sultan&rsquo;s
brother, who was travelling through Alexandria,
sent a festival-garment to his master to
have some change made in it, and the master
gave it to Labakan, because he did the finest
work. In the evening, when the apprentices
had all gone forth to refresh themselves after
the labor of the day, an irresistible desire
drove Labakan back into the workshop, where
the garment of the sultan&rsquo;s brother was hanging.
He stood some time, in reflection, before
it, admiring now the splendor of the embroidery,
now the varied colors of the velvet
and silk. He cannot help it, he must put it
on; and, lo! it fits him as handsomely as if it
were made for him. &ldquo;Am not I as good a
prince as any?&rdquo; asked he of himself, as he
strutted up and down the room. &ldquo;Has not
my master himself said, that I was born for a
prince?&rdquo; With the garments, the apprentice
seemed to have assumed quite a kingly carriage;
he could believe nothing else, than that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg&nbsp;179]</a></span>
he was a king&rsquo;s son in obscurity, and as such
he resolved to travel forth into the world,
leaving a city where the people hitherto had
been so foolish as not to discover his innate
dignity beneath the veil of his inferior station.
The splendid garment seemed sent to him by
a good fairy; resolving therefore not to slight
so precious a gift, he put his little stock of
money in his pocket, and, favored by the darkness
of the night, wandered forth from Alexandria&rsquo;s
gates.</p>

<p>The new prince excited admiration everywhere
upon his route, for the splendid garment,
and his serious majestic air, would not
allow him to pass for a common pedestrian.
If one inquired of him about it, he took care to
answer, with a mysterious look, that he had his
reasons for it. Perceiving, however, that he
rendered himself an object of ridicule by travelling
on foot, he purchased for a small sum an
old horse, which suited him very well, for it
never brought his habitual quiet and mildness
into difficulty, by compelling him to show
himself off as an excellent rider, a thing which
in reality he was not.</p>

<p>One day, as he was proceeding on his way,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg&nbsp;180]</a></span>
step by step, upon his Murva, (thus had he
named his horse,) a stranger joined him, and
asked permission to travel in his company,
since to him the distance would seem much
shorter, in conversation with another. The
rider was a gay young man, elegant and genteel
in manners. He soon knit up a conversation
with Labakan, with respect to his
whence and whither, and it turned out that
he also, like the journeyman tailor, was travelling
without purpose, in the world. He
said his name was Omar, that he was the
nephew of Elfi Bey, the unfortunate bashaw
of Cairo, and was now on his way to execute
a commission which his uncle had delivered
to him upon his dying-bed. Labakan was not
so frank with respect to his circumstances;
he gave him to understand that he was of lofty
descent, and was travelling for pleasure.</p>

<p>The two young men were pleased with each
other, and rode on in company. On the second
day, Labakan interrogated his companion
Omar, respecting the commission with which
he was charged, and to his astonishment learned
the following. Elfi Bey, the bashaw of
Cairo, had brought up Omar from his earliest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg&nbsp;181]</a></span>
childhood; the young man had never known
his parents. But shortly before, Elfi Bey, having
been attacked by his enemies, and, after
three disastrous engagements, mortally wounded,
was obliged to flee, and disclosed to his
charge that he was not his nephew, but the
son of a powerful lord, who, inspired with fear
by the prophecy of his astrologer, had sent the
young prince away from his court, with an
oath never to see him again until his twenty-second
birthday. Elfi Bey had not told him
his father&rsquo;s name, but had enjoined upon him
with the greatest precision, on the fourth day
of the coming month Ramadan, on which day
he would be two-and-twenty years old, to repair
to the celebrated pillar El-Serujah, four
days&rsquo; journey east of Alexandria: there he
should offer to the men who would be standing
by the pillar, a dagger which he gave him,
with these words, &ldquo;Here am I, whom ye
seek!&rdquo; If they answered, &ldquo;Blessed be the
Prophet, who has preserved thee!&rdquo; then he
was to follow them&mdash;they would lead him to
his father.</p>

<p>The journeyman tailor, Labakan, was much
astonished at this information; from this time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg&nbsp;182]</a></span>
he looked upon Prince Omar with envious
eyes, irritated because fortune conferred upon
him, though already he passed for the nephew
of a mighty bashaw, the dignity of a king&rsquo;s
son; but on him, whom she had endowed with
all things necessary for a prince, bestowed in
ridicule, an obscure lineage, and an every-day
vocation. He instituted a comparison between
himself and the prince. He was obliged to
confess that the latter was a man of very
lively aspect; that fine sparkling eyes belonged
to him, a boldly-arched nose, a gentlemanly,
complaisant demeanor, in a word, all the external
accomplishments, which every one is wont
to commend. But numerous as were the
charms he found in his companion, still he
was compelled to acknowledge to himself, that
a Labakan would be no less acceptable to the
royal father than the genuine prince.</p>

<p>These thoughts pursued Labakan the whole
day; with them he went to sleep in the nearest
night-lodgings; but when he awoke in the
morning, and his eye rested upon Omar sleeping
near him, who was reposing so quietly,
and could dream of his now certain fortune,
then arose in him the thought of gaining, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg&nbsp;183]</a></span>
stratagem or violence, what unpropitious destiny
had denied him. The dagger, the returning
prince&rsquo;s token of recognition, hung in the
sleeper&rsquo;s girdle; he softly drew it forth, to
plunge it in the breast of its owner. Nevertheless,
the peaceable soul of the journeyman
recoiled before thoughts of murder; he contented
himself with appropriating the dagger,
and bridling for himself the faster horse of the
prince; and, ere Omar awoke to see himself
despoiled of all his hopes, his perfidious companion
was several miles upon his way.</p>

<p>The day on which Labakan robbed the
prince was the first of the holy month Ramadan,
and he had therefore four days to reach
the pillar El-Serujah, the locality of which was
well known to him. Although the region
wherein it was situated could at farthest be at
a distance of but four days&rsquo; journey, still he
hastened to reach it, through a constant fear of
being overtaken by the real prince.</p>

<p>By the end of the second day, he came in
sight of the pillar El-Serujah. It stood upon a
little elevation, in the midst of an extensive
plain, and could be seen at a distance of two
or three leagues. Labakan&rsquo;s heart beat high
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
at the sight: though he had had time enough on
horseback, for the last two days, to think of
the part he was to play, still a consciousness of
guilt made him anxious; the thought that he
was born for a prince, however, encouraged
him again, and he advanced towards the mark
with renewed confidence.</p>

<p>The country around the pillar was uninhabited
and desert, and the new prince would have
experienced some difficulty in finding sustenance,
if he had not previously supplied himself
for several days. He lay down beside his
horse beneath some palm-trees, and there
awaited his distant destiny.</p>

<p>Towards the middle of the next day, he saw
a large procession of horses and camels crossing
the plain in the direction of the pillar El-Serujah.
It reached the foot of the hill, on
which the pillar stood; there they pitched
splendid tents, and the whole looked like the
travelling-suite of some rich bashaw or sheik.
Labakan perceived that the numerous train
which met his eye, had taken the pains to
come hither on his account, and gladly would
he that moment have shown them their future
lord; but he mastered his eager desire to walk
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
as prince; for, indeed, the next morning would
consummate his boldest wishes.</p>

<p>The morning sun awoke the too happy
tailor to the most important moment of his
life, which would elevate him from an inferior
situation, to the side of a royal father. As he
was bridling his horse to ride to the pillar, the
injustice of his course, indeed, occurred to him;
his thoughts pictured to him the anguish of the
true prince, betrayed in his fine hopes; but the
die was cast: what was done could not be undone,
and self-love whispered to him that he
looked stately enough to pass for the son of the
mightiest king. Inspirited by these reflections,
he sprang upon his horse, and collecting all his
courage to bring him to an ordinary gallop, in
less than a quarter of an hour, reached the
foot of the hill. He dismounted from his horse,
and fastened it to one of the shrubs that were
growing near; then he drew the dagger of
Prince Omar, and proceeded up the hill. At
the base of the pillar six persons were standing
around an old gray-haired man, of lofty king-like
aspect. A splendid caftan of gold cloth
surrounded by a white Cashmere shawl, a
snowy turban spangled with glittering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg&nbsp;186]</a></span>
precious stones, pointed him out as a man of
opulence and nobility. To him Labakan proceeded,
and bowing low before him, said, as he
extended the dagger&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here am I, whom you seek.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Praise to the Prophet who has preserved
thee!&rdquo; answered the gray-haired one, with
tears of joy. &ldquo;Omar, my beloved son, embrace
thine old father!&rdquo; The good tailor was
deeply affected by these solemn words, and
sank, with mingled emotions of joy and shame,
into the arms of the old noble.</p>

<p>But only for a moment was he to enjoy the
unclouded delight of his new rank; raising
himself from the arms of the king, he saw a
rider hastening over the plain in the direction
of the hill. The traveller and his horse presented
a strange appearance; the animal,
either from obstinacy or fatigue, seemed unwilling
to proceed. He went along with a
stumbling gait, which was neither a pace nor
a trot; but the rider urged him on, with hands
and feet, to a faster run. Only too soon did
Labakan recognise his horse Murva, and the
real Prince Omar. But the evil spirit of falsehood
once more prevailed within him, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg&nbsp;187]</a></span>
resolved, come what might, with unmoved
front to support the rights he had usurped.
Already, in the distance, had they observed
the horseman making signs; at length, in spite
of Murva&rsquo;s slow gait, having reached the bottom
of the hill, he threw himself from his
horse, and began rapidly to ascend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cried he. &ldquo;Hold! whoever you
may be, and suffer not yourselves to be deceived
by a most infamous impostor! I am
called Omar, and let no mortal venture to misuse
my name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Great astonishment was depicted on the
countenances of the bystanders at this turn
of the affair; the old man, in particular, seemed
to be much amazed, as he looked inquiringly
on one and another. Thereupon Labakan
spoke, with a composure gained only by the
most powerful effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most gracious lord and father, be not led
astray by this man. He is, as far as I know, a
mad journeyman tailor of Alexandria, by name
Labakan, who deserves rather our pity than
our anger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These words excited the prince almost to
phrensy. Foaming with passion, he would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg&nbsp;188]</a></span>
have sprung upon Labakan, but the bystanders,
throwing themselves between, secured him,
while the old man said: &ldquo;Truly, my beloved
son, the poor man is crazed. Let them bind
him and place him on one of our dromedaries;
perhaps we may be of some assistance to the
unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anger of the prince had abated; in
tears, he cried out to the old man, &ldquo;My heart
tells me that you are my father; by the memory
of my mother, I conjure you&mdash;hear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! God guard us!&rdquo; answered he: &ldquo;already
he again begins to talk wildly. How
can the man come by such crazy thoughts?&rdquo;
Thereupon, seizing Labakan&rsquo;s arm, he made
him accompany him down the hill. They
both mounted fine and richly-caparisoned coursers,
and rode at the head of the procession,
across the plain. They tied the hands of the
unfortunate prince, however, and bound him
securely upon a dromedary. Two horsemen
rode constantly by his side, who kept a watchful
eye upon his every movement.</p>

<p>The old prince was Saoud, sultan of the
Wechabites. For some time had he lived
without children; at last a prince, for whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg&nbsp;189]</a></span>
he had so ardently longed, was born to him.
But the astrologer, whom he consulted respecting
the destiny of his son, told him that, until
his twenty-second year, he would be in danger
of being supplanted by an enemy. On that
account, in order that he might be perfectly
safe, had the sultan given him, to be brought
up, to his old and tried friend, Elfi Bey; and
twenty-two sad years had lived without looking
upon him.</p>

<p>This did the sultan impart to his supposed
son, and seemed delighted beyond measure
with his figure and dignified demeanor.</p>

<p>When they reached the sultan&rsquo;s dominions,
they were everywhere received by the inhabitants
with shouts of joy; for the rumor of the
prince&rsquo;s arrival had spread like wildfire through
the cities and towns. In the streets through
which they proceeded, arches of flowers and
branches were erected; bright carpets of all
colors adorned the houses; and the people
loudly praised God and his prophet, who had
discovered to them so noble a prince. All this
filled the proud heart of the tailor with delight:
so much the more unhappy did it make the
real Omar, who, still bound, followed the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg&nbsp;190]</a></span>
procession in silent despair. In this universal
jubilee, though it was all in his honor, no one
paid him any attention. A thousand, and
again a thousand, voices shouted the name of
Omar; but of him who really bore this name,
of him none took notice: at most, only one or
two inquired whom they were carrying with
them, so tightly bound, and frightfully in the
ears of the prince sounded the answer of his
guards, &ldquo;It is a mad tailor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession at last reached the capital
of the sultan, where all was prepared for their
reception with still more brilliancy than in the
other cities. The sultana, an elderly woman
of majestic appearance, awaited them, with
her whole court, in the most splendid saloon of
the castle. The floor of this room was covered
with a large carpet; the walls were adorned
with bright blue tapestry, which was suspended
from massive silver hooks, by cords and tassels
of gold.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 519px;">
<img src="images/tosb15.jpg" width="519" height="600"
alt="An elaborately robed woman, wearing much gold, sits on a gold-embellished divan" />
</div>

<p>It was dark by the time the procession came
up, and accordingly many globular colored
lamps were lighted in the saloon, which made
night brilliant as day; but with the clearest
brilliancy and most varied colors, shone those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg&nbsp;191]</a></span>
in the farthest part of the saloon, where the
sultana was seated upon a throne. The throne
stood upon four steps, and was of pure gold,
inlaid with amethysts. The four most illustrious
emirs held a canopy of crimson silk over
the head of their mistress; and the sheik of
Medina cooled her with a fan of peacock
feathers. Thus awaited the sultana her husband
and son; the latter she had never looked
on since his birth, but significant dreams had
so plainly shown her the object of her longings,
that she would know him out of thousands.</p>

<p>Now they heard the noise of the approaching
troop; trumpets and drums mingled
with the huzzas of the populace; the hoofs of
the horses sounded on the court of the palace;
steps came nearer and nearer; the doors of
the room flew open, and, through rows of
prostrate attendants, hastened the sultan, holding
his son by the hand, towards the mother&rsquo;s
throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do I bring to thee, him
for whom thou hast so often longed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sultana, however, interrupted him, crying:
&ldquo;This is not my son! These are not the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg&nbsp;192]</a></span>
features which the Prophet has shown me in
my dreams!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just as the sultan was about to rebuke her
superstition, the door of the saloon sprang
open, and Prince Omar rushed in, followed by
his guards, whom an exertion of his whole
strength had enabled him to escape. Breathless,
he threw himself before the throne, exclaiming:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here will I die! Kill me, cruel father, for
this disgrace I can endure no longer!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All were confounded at these words; they
pressed around the unfortunate one, and already
were the guards, who had hurried up, on
the point of seizing him and replacing his fetters,
when the sultana, who had thus far looked
on in mute astonishment, sprang from the
throne.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;this, and no other, is
my son! This is he, who, though my eyes
have never seen him, is well known to my
heart!&rdquo; The guards had involuntarily fallen
back from Omar, but the sultan, foaming with
rage, commanded them to bind the madman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is mine to decide,&rdquo; he cried with commanding
tone; &ldquo;and here we will judge, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg&nbsp;193]</a></span>
by a woman&rsquo;s dreams, but by sure and infallible
signs. This,&rdquo; pointing to Labakan, &ldquo;is
my son, for he has brought me the dagger, the
real token of my friend Elfi.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He stole it,&rdquo; cried Omar; &ldquo;my unsuspicious
confidence has he treacherously abused!&rdquo;
But the sultan hearkened not to the voice of
his son, for he was wont in all things obstinately
to follow his own judgment. He bade
them forcibly drag the unfortunate Omar from
the saloon, and himself retired with Labakan
to his chamber, filled with anger at his wife,
with whom, nevertheless, he had lived in happiness
for five-and-twenty years. The sultana
was full of grief at this affair; she was perfectly
convinced that an impostor had taken possession
of the sultan&rsquo;s heart, so numerous and
distinct had been the dreams which pointed
out the unhappy Omar as her son. When her
sorrow had a little abated, she reflected on the
means of convincing her husband of his mistake.
This was indeed difficult, for he who
had passed himself off as her son, had presented
the dagger, the token of recognition, and
had, moreover, as she learned, become acquainted
with so much of Omar&rsquo;s early life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg&nbsp;194]</a></span>
from the lips of the prince himself, as to be
able to play his part without betraying himself.</p>

<p>She called to her the men who had attended
the sultan to the pillar El-Serujah, in order to
have the whole matter exactly laid before her,
and then took counsel with her most trusty
female slaves. She chose, and in a moment
rejected, this means and that; at length,
Melechsalah, an old and cunning Circassian,
spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have heard rightly, honored mistress,
the one who bore this dagger called him whom
thou holdest to be thy son, a crazy tailor, Labakan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; answered the sultana; &ldquo;but
what wilt thou make of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What think you,&rdquo; proceeded the slave, &ldquo;of
this impostor&rsquo;s having stitched his own name
upon your son? If this be so, we have an excellent
way of catching the deceiver, which I
will impart to you in private.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sultana gave ear to her slave, and the
latter whispered to her a plan which seemed to
please her, for she immediately got ready to
go to the sultan. The sultana was a sensible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg&nbsp;195]</a></span>
woman, and knew not only the weak side of
her husband, but also the way to take advantage
of it. She seemed therefore to give up,
and to be willing to acknowledge her son, only
offering one condition: the sultan, whom the
outbreak between himself and his wife had
grieved, agreed thereto, and she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would fain have from each a proof of his
skill; another, perhaps, would have them contend
in riding, in single conflict, or in hurling
spears: but these are things which every one
can do; I will give them something which
will require both knowledge and dexterity. It
shall be this; each shall make a caftan, and a
pair of pantaloons, and then will we see at
once who can make the finest ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sultan laughingly answered, &ldquo;Ah! thou
hast hit on a fine expedient! Shall my son
contend with a mad tailor, to see who can
make the best caftan? No! that cannot be.&rdquo;
The sultana, however, cried out, that he had
already agreed to the condition, and her husband,
who was a man of his word, at length
yielded, though he swore, should the mad tailor
make his caftan ever so beautiful, he would
never acknowledge him as his son.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg&nbsp;196]</a></span>
The sultan thereupon went to his son, and
entreated him to submit to the caprices of his
mother, who now positively wished to see a
caftan from his hands. The heart of the good
Labakan laughed with delight; if that be all
that is wanting, thought he to himself, then
shall the lady sultana soon behold me with joy.
Two rooms had been fitted up, one for the
prince, the other for the tailor; there were
they to try their skill, and each was furnished
with shears, needles, thread, and a sufficient
quantity of silk.</p>

<p>The sultan was very eager to see what sort
of a caftan his son would bring to light, but the
heart of the sultana beat unquietly, from apprehension
lest her stratagem might be unsuccessful.
Two days had they been confined to
their work; on the third, the sultan sent for his
wife, and when she appeared, dispatched her
to the apartments to bring the two caftans and
their makers. With triumphant air Labakan
walked in, and extended his garment before
the astonished eyes of the sultan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Behold, father,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;look, mother!
see if this be not a masterpiece of a caftan. I
will leave it to the most skilful court-tailor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg&nbsp;197]</a></span>
upon a wager, whether he can produce such
another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sultana, smiling, turned to Omar:&mdash;&nbsp;
&ldquo;And thou, my son, what hast thou brought?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indignantly he cast the silk and shears upon
the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They have taught me to tame horses, and
to swing my sabre; and my lance will strike
you a mark at sixty paces. But the art of the
needle is unknown to me; it were unworthy
a pupil of Elfi Bey, the lord of Cairo!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thou true son of my heart!&rdquo; exclaimed
the sultana. &ldquo;Ah, that I might embrace thee,
and call thee, son! Forgive me, husband and
master,&rdquo; she continued, turning to the sultan,
&ldquo;for having set on foot this stratagem against
you. See you not now who is prince, and
who tailor? Of a truth the caftan which your
lord son has made, is magnificent, and I would
fain ask with what master he has learned!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sultan was lost in deep reflection, looking
with distrust, now on his wife, now on
Labakan, who vainly sought to conceal his
blushes and consternation at having so stupidly
betrayed himself. &ldquo;This proof pleases me not,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;but, Allah be praised! I know a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg&nbsp;198]</a></span>
means of learning whether I am deceived.&rdquo;
He commanded them to bring his swiftest
horse, mounted, and rode to a forest, which
commenced not far from the city. There, according
to an old tradition, lived a good fairy,
named Adolzaide, who had often before this
assisted with her advice the monarchs of his
family, in the hour of need: thither hastened
the sultan.</p>

<p>In the middle of the wood was an open
place, surrounded by lofty cedars. There, the
story said, lived the fairy; and seldom did a
mortal visit this spot, for a certain awe connected
with it had, from olden time, descended
from father to son. When the sultan had
drawn near he dismounted, tied his horse to a
tree, and placing himself in the middle of the
open space, cried with loud voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it be true that thou hast given good
counsel to my fathers, in the hour of need,
then disdain not the request of their descendant,
and advise me in a case where human
understanding is too short-sighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he uttered the last word, when
one of the cedars opened, and a veiled lady, in
long white garments, stepped forth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg&nbsp;199]</a></span>
&ldquo;I know, Sultan Saoud, why thou comest
to me; thy wish is fair, therefore shall my assistance
be thine. Take these two chests; let
each of the two who claim to be thy son,
choose; I know that he who is the real one,
will not make a wrong selection.&rdquo; Thus
speaking, the veiled lady extended to him two
little caskets of ivory, richly adorned with gold
and pearls: upon the lids, which he vainly
sought to open, were inscriptions formed by
inlaid diamonds.</p>

<p>As he was riding home, the sultan tormented
himself with various conjectures, as to what
might be the contents of the caskets, which, do
his best, he could not open. The words on the
outside threw no light upon the matter; for on
one was inscribed, <span class="smcap">Honor and Fame</span>; upon
the other, <span class="smcap">Fortune and Wealth</span>. Saoud
thought it would be difficult to make choice
between these two, which seemed equally attractive,
equally alluring. When he reached
the palace, he sent for his wife, and told her
the answer of the fairy: it filled her with an
eager hope, that he to whom her heart clung,
might select the casket which would indicate
his royal origin.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg&nbsp;200]</a></span>
Two tables were brought in before the sultan&rsquo;s
throne; on these, with his own hand,
Saoud placed the two boxes; then, ascending
to his seat, he gave the signal to one of his
slaves to open the door of the saloon. A brilliant
throng of bashaws and emirs of the
realm poured through the open door: they
seated themselves on the splendid cushions,
which were arranged around the walls. When
they had done this, Saoud gave a second signal,
and Labakan was introduced; with haughty
step he walked through the apartment, and
prostrated himself before the throne with these
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the command of my lord and father?&rdquo;
The sultan raised himself in his throne,
and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My son, doubts are entertained as to the
genuineness of thy claims to this name; one
of these chests contains the confirmation of
thy real birth. Choose! I doubt not thou wilt
select the right one!&rdquo; Labakan raised himself,
and advanced towards the boxes; for a long
time he reflected as to which he should choose,
at last he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honored father, what can be loftier than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg&nbsp;201]</a></span>
the fortune of being thy son? What more
noble than the wealth of thy favor? I choose
the chest which bears the inscription, <span class="smcap">Fortune
And Wealth</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will soon learn whether thou hast
made the right choice; meanwhile sit down
upon that cushion, near the bashaw of Medina,&rdquo;
said the sultan, again motioning to his
slaves.</p>

<p>Omar was led in; his eye was mournful, his
air dejected, and his appearance excited universal
sympathy among the spectators. He
threw himself before the throne, and inquired
after the sultan&rsquo;s pleasure. Saoud informed
him that he was to choose one of the chests:
he arose, and approached the table. He read
attentively both inscriptions, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The few last days have informed me how
insecure is fortune, how transient is wealth;
but they have also taught me that, in the breast
of the brave, lives what can never be destroyed,
<span class="smcap lowercase">HONOR</span>, and that the bright star of <span class="smcap lowercase">RENOWN</span>
sets not with fortune. The die is cast! should
I resign a crown, Honor and Fame, you are
my choice!&rdquo; He placed his hand upon the
casket that he had chosen, but the sultan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg&nbsp;202]</a></span>
commanded him not to unclose it, while he motioned
to Labakan to advance, in like manner,
before his table. He did so, and at the same
time grasped his box. The sultan, however,
had a chalice brought in, with water from
Zemzem, the holy fountain of Mecca, washed
his hands for supplication, and, turning his face
to the East, prostrated himself in prayer:</p>

<p>&ldquo;God of my fathers! Thou, who for centuries
hast established our family, pure and unadulterated,
grant that no unworthy one disgrace
the name of the Abassid&aelig;; be with thy
protection near my real son, in this hour of
trial.&rdquo; The sultan arose, and reascended his
throne. Universal expectation enchained all
present; they scarcely breathed; one could
have heard a mouse crawl over the hall, so
mute and attentive were all. The hindmost
extended their necks, in order to get a view of
the chests, over the heads of those in front.
The sultan spoke: &ldquo;Open the chests;&rdquo; and
they, which before no violence could force,
now sprang open of their own accord.</p>

<p>In the one which Omar had chosen, lay
upon a velvet cushion, a small golden crown,
and a sceptre: in Labakan&rsquo;s, a large needle,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg&nbsp;203]</a></span>
and a little linen thread. The sultan commanded
both to bring their caskets before him:
he took the little crown from the cushion in
his hand, and, wonderful to see! it became
larger and larger, until it reached the size of a
real crown. Placing it on his son Omar, who
kneeled before him, he kissed his forehead, and
bade him sit upon his right hand. To Labakan,
however, he turned and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is an old proverb, &lsquo;Shoemaker, stick
to thy last;&rsquo; it seems that thou shouldst stick
to thy needle. Thou hast not, indeed, merited
much mercy at my hands, but one has supplicated
for thee, whom this day I can refuse
nothing; therefore give I thee thy paltry life;
but, if I may advise, haste thee to leave my land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ashamed, ruined as he was, the poor tailor
could answer nothing: he threw himself before
the prince, and tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you forgive me, prince?&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be true to a friend, magnanimous to a
foe, is the pride of the Abassid&aelig;!&rdquo; answered
the prince, raising him. &ldquo;Go in peace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My true son!&rdquo; cried the old sultan, deeply
affected, and sinking upon Omar&rsquo;s breast. The
emirs and bashaws, and all the nobles of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg&nbsp;204]</a></span>
realm, arose from their seats, to welcome the
new prince, and amid this universal jubilee,
Labakan, his chest under his arm, crept out of
the saloon.</p>

<p>He went down into the sultan&rsquo;s stable, bridled
his horse Murva, and rode forth from the
gate towards Alexandria. His whole career
as prince recurred to him as a dream, and the
splendid chest, richly adorned with pearls and
diamonds, alone convinced him that it was not
all an idle vision. Having at last reached
Alexandria, he rode to the house of his old
master, dismounted, and fastening his horse to
the door, walked into the workshop. The
master, who did not even know him, made a
low bow and asked what was his pleasure:
when, however, he had a nearer view of his
guest, and recognised his old Labakan, he
called to his journeymen and apprentices, and
all precipitated themselves, like mad, upon poor
Labakan, who expected no such reception;
they bruised and beat him with smoothing-irons
and yard-sticks, pricked him with needles,
and pinched him with sharp shears, until
he sank down, exhausted, on a heap of old
clothes. As he lay there, the master ceased,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg&nbsp;205]</a></span>
for a moment, from his blows, to ask after the
stolen garments: in vain Labakan assured
him that he had come back on that account
alone, to set all right; in vain offered him
threefold compensation for his loss; the master
and his journeymen fell upon him again,
beat him terribly, and turned him out of doors.
Sore and bruised, he mounted Murva, and rode
to a caravansery. There he laid down his
weary lacerated head, reflecting on the sorrows
of earth, on merit so often unrewarded, and on
the nothingness and transientness of all human
blessings. He went to sleep with the determination
to give up all hopes of greatness, and to
become an honest burgher. Nor on the following
day did he repent of his resolution, for
the heavy hands of his master, and the journeymen,
had cudgelled out of him all thoughts of
nobility.</p>

<p>He sold his box to a jeweller for a high
price, and fitted up a workshop for his business.
When he had arranged all, and had
hung out, before his window, a sign with the
inscription, <span class="smcap">Labakan, Merchant Tailor</span>, he
sat down and began with the needle and thread
he had found in the chest, to mend the coat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg&nbsp;206]</a></span>
which his master had so shockingly torn. He
was called off from his work, but on returning
to it, what a wonderful sight met his eyes!
The needle was sewing industriously away,
without being touched by any one; it took fine,
elegant stitches, such as Labakan himself had
never made even in his most skilful moments.</p>

<p>Truly the smallest present of a kind fairy is
useful, and of great value! Still another good
quality had the gift; be the needle as industrious
as it might, the little stock of thread never
gave out.</p>

<p>Labakan obtained many customers, and was
soon the most famous tailor for miles around.
He cut out the garments, and took the first
stitch therein with the needle, and immediately
the latter worked away, without cessation, until
the whole was completed. Master Labakan
soon had the whole city for customers, for
his work was beautiful, and his charges low;
and only one thing troubled the brains of the
people of Alexandria, namely, how he finished
his work entirely without journeymen, and with
closed doors.</p>

<p>Thus was the motto of the chest which
promised fortune and wealth undergoing its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
accomplishment. <span class="smcap">Fortune and Wealth</span> accompanied,
with gradual increase, the steps of
the good tailor, and when he listened to the
praises of the young sultan Omar, who lived in
every mouth; when he heard that this brave
man was the object of his people&rsquo;s pride and
love, the terror of his enemies; then would
the quondam prince say to himself, &ldquo;Still is it
better that I remained a tailor, for <span class="smcap">Honor and
Fame</span> are ever accompanied by danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus lived Labakan, contented with himself,
respected by his fellow-burghers; and if the
needle, meanwhile, has not lost her cunning,
she is still sewing with the everlasting thread
of the good Fairy Adolzaide.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
At sundown the Caravan set out, and soon
reached Birket-el-had, or &ldquo;the Pilgrims&rsquo; Fountain,&rdquo;
whence the distance to Cairo was three
leagues. The Caravan had been expected at
this time, and the merchants soon had the pleasure
of seeing their friends coming forth from
the city to meet them. They entered through
the gate Bebel-Falch, for it was considered a
good omen for those who came from Mecca
to enter by this gate, because the Prophet himself
had passed through it.</p>

<p>At the market-place the four Turkish merchants
took leave of the stranger and the
Greek Zaleukos, and went home with their
friends. Zaleukos, however, showed his companion
a good caravansery, and invited him to
dine with him. The stranger agreed, and
promised to make his appearance as soon as
he should have changed his dress. The Greek
made every arrangement for giving a fine
entertainment to the stranger, for whom, upon
the journey, he had conceived a deep feeling of
esteem; and when the meats and drink had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
been brought in in proper order, he seated himself,
waiting for his guest.</p>

<p>He heard slow and heavy steps approaching
through the gallery which led to their
apartment. He arose in order to meet him as
a friend, and welcome him upon the threshold;
but, full of horror, he started back as the door
opened&mdash;the same frightful Red-mantle walked
in before him! His eyes were still turned
upon him; it was no illusion: the same lofty,
commanding figure, the mask, from beneath
which shone forth the dark eyes, the red cloak
with embroidery of gold&mdash;all were but too
well known to him, impressed upon his mind
as they had been during the most awful moments
of his life.</p>

<p>The breast of Zaleukos heaved with contending
emotions; he had long since felt
reconciled towards this too-well-remembered
apparition, and forgiven him; nevertheless
his sudden appearance opened every wound
afresh. All those torturing hours of anguish,
that wo which had envenomed the bloom of
his life, rushed back for a moment, crowding
upon his soul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What wishest thou, terrible one?&rdquo; cried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
the Greek, as the apparition still stood motionless
upon the threshold. &ldquo;Away with thee,
that I may curse thee not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Zaleukos!&rdquo; said a well-known voice from
under the mask: &ldquo;Zaleukos! is it thus that
you receive your guest?&rdquo; The speaker removed
the mask, and threw back his cloak:
it was Selim Baruch, the stranger! But still
Zaleukos seemed not at ease, for he too plainly
recognised in him the Unknown of the Ponte
Vecchio: nevertheless, old habits of hospitality
conquered; he silently motioned to the
stranger to seat himself at the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can guess your thoughts,&rdquo; commenced
the latter, when they had taken their places:
&ldquo;your eyes look inquiringly upon me. I
might have been silent, and your gaze would
never more have beheld me; but I owe you
an explanation, and therefore did I venture to
appear before you in my former guise, even at
the risk of receiving your curse. You once
said to me, &lsquo;The faith of my fathers bids me
love him; and he is probably more unhappy
than myself:&rsquo; be assured of this, my friend,
and listen to my justification.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must begin far back, in order that you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>
may fully understand my story. I was born
in Alexandria, of Christian parents. My father,
the youngest son of an ancient illustrious
French family, was consul for his native land
in the city I have just mentioned. From my
tenth year I was brought up in France, by one
of my mother&rsquo;s brothers, and left my fatherland
for the first time a few years after the
revolution broke out there, in company with
my uncle, who was no longer safe in the land
of his ancestors, in order to seek refuge with
my parents beyond the sea. We landed eagerly,
hoping to find in my father&rsquo;s house the rest
and quiet of which the troubles of France had
deprived us. But ah! in my father&rsquo;s house I
found not all as it should be: the external
storms of these stirring times had not, it is
true, reached it; but the more unexpectedly
had misfortune made her home in the inmost
hearts of my family. My brother, a promising
young man, first secretary of my father, had
shortly before married a young lady, the
daughter of a Florentine noble who lived in
our vicinity: two days before our arrival she
had suddenly disappeared, and neither our
family nor her own father could discern the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg&nbsp;212]</a></span>
slightest trace of her. At last they came to
the conclusion that she had ventured too far
in a walk, and had fallen into the hands of
robbers. Almost agreeable was this thought
to my poor brother, when compared to the
truth, which only too soon became known. The
perfidious one had eloped with a young Neapolitan,
with whom she had become acquainted
in her father&rsquo;s house. My brother, who
was exceedingly affected by this step, employed
every means to bring the guilty one to punishment;
but in vain: his attempts, which in
Naples and Florence had excited wonder,
served only to complete his and our misfortune.
The Florentine nobleman returned to
his native land, under the pretence of seeing
justice done to my brother, but with the real
determination of destroying us all. He frustrated
all those examinations which my brother
had set on foot, and knew how to use his influence,
which he had obtained in various ways,
so well, that my father and brother fell under
suspicion of their government, were seized in
the most shameful manner, carried to France,
and there suffered death by the axe of the executioner.
My poor mother lost her mind;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg&nbsp;213]</a></span>
and not until ten long months had passed, did
death release her from her awful situation,
though for the few last days she was possessed
of perfect consciousness. Thus did I now
stand isolated in the world: one thought alone
occupied my whole soul, one thought alone
bade me forget my sorrows; it was the mighty
flame which my mother in her last moments
had kindled within me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In her last moments, as I said, recollection
returned; she had me summoned, and spoke
with composure of our fate, and her own death.
Then she sent all out of the room, raised herself,
with a solemn air, from her miserable bed,
and said that I should receive her blessing, if I
would swear to accomplish something with
which she would charge me. Amazed at the
words of my dying mother, I promised with
an oath to do whatever she should tell me. She
thereupon broke forth in imprecations against
the Florentine and his daughter, and charged
me, with the most frightful threats of her curse,
to avenge upon him the misfortunes of my
house. She died in my arms. This thought
of vengeance had long slumbered in my soul;
it now awoke in all its might. I collected what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg&nbsp;214]</a></span>
remained of my paternal property, and bound
myself by an oath to stake it all upon revenge,
and, rather than be unsuccessful, to perish in
the attempt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I soon arrived in Florence, where I kept
myself as private as possible; it was very difficult
to put my plan in execution on account
of the situation which my enemy occupied.
The old Florentine had become governor, and
thus had in his hand all the means of destroying
me, should he entertain the slightest suspicion.
An accident came to my assistance.
One evening I saw a man in well-known livery,
walking through the streets: his uncertain
gait, his gloomy appearance, and the muttered
&lsquo;Santo sacramento,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Maledetto diavolo,&rsquo;
soon made me recognise old Pietro, a servant
of the Florentine, whom I had formerly known
in Alexandria. There was no doubt but that
he was in a passion with his master, and I resolved
to turn his humor to my advantage.
He appeared much surprised to see me there,
told me his grievances, that he could do nothing
aright for his master since he had become
governor, and my gold supported by his anger
soon brought him over to my side. Most of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg&nbsp;215]</a></span>
the difficulty was now removed: I had a man
in my pay, who would open to me at any hour
the doors of my enemy, and from this time my
plan of vengeance advanced to maturity with
still greater rapidity. The life of the old Florentine
seemed to me too pitiful a thing, to be
put into the balance with that of my whole
family. Murdered before him, he must see
the dearest object of his love, and this was his
daughter Bianca. It was she that had so
shamefully wronged my brother, it was she
that had been the author of our misfortunes.
My heart, thirsting for revenge, eagerly drank
in the intelligence, that Bianca was on the
point of being married a second time; it was
settled&mdash;she must die. But as my soul recoiled
at the deed, and I attributed too little nerve to
Pietro, we looked around for a man to accomplish
our fell design. I could hire no Florentine,
for there was none that would have undertaken
such a thing against the governor.
Thereupon Pietro hit upon a plan, which I afterwards
adopted, and he thereupon proposed
you, being a foreigner and a physician, as the
proper person. The result you know: only,
through your excessive foresight and honesty,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg&nbsp;216]</a></span>
my undertaking seemed, at one time, to be tottering;
hence the scene with the mantle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pietro opened for us the little gate in the
governor&rsquo;s palace; he would have let us out,
also, in the same secret manner, if we had not
fled, overcome by horror at the frightful spectacle,
which, through the crack of the door,
presented itself to our eyes. Pursued by terror
and remorse, I ran on about two hundred
paces, until I sank down upon the steps of a
church. There I collected myself again, and
my first thought was of you, and your awful
fate, if found within the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I crept back to the palace, but neither of
Pietro nor yourself could I discover a single
trace. The door, however, was open, and I
could at least hope that you had not neglected
this opportunity of flight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when the day broke, fear of detection,
and an unconquerable feeling of remorse, allowed
me to remain no longer within the walls
of Florence. I hastened to Rome. Imagine
my consternation, when, after a few days, the
story was everywhere told, with the addition
that, in a Grecian physician, they had detected
the murderer. In anxious fear, I returned to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg&nbsp;217]</a></span>
Florence; my vengeance now seemed too
great: I cursed it again and again, for with
your life it was purchased all too dearly. I
arrived on the same day which cost you a
hand. I will not tell you what I felt, when I
saw you ascend the scaffold, and bear all with
such heroism. But when the blood gushed
forth in streams, then was my resolution taken,
to sweeten the rest of your days. What has
since happened you know; it only now remains
to tell you, why I have travelled with
you. As the thought that you had never yet
forgiven me, pressed heavily upon me, I determined
to spend some days with you, and at
last to give you an explanation of what I had
done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silently had the Greek listened to his guest;
with a kind look, as he finished, he offered him
his right hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I knew very well that you must be more
unhappy than I, for that awful deed will, like
a thick cloud, forever darken your days. From
my heart I forgive you. But answer me yet
one question: how came you under this form,
in the wilderness? What did you set about,
after purchasing my house in Constantinople?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg&nbsp;218]</a></span>
&ldquo;I returned to Alexandria,&rdquo; answered the
guest. &ldquo;Hate against all mankind raged in
my bosom; burning hate, in particular, against
that people, whom they call &lsquo;the polished nation.&rsquo;
Believe me, my Moslem friends pleased
me better. Scarcely a month had I been in
Alexandria, when the invasion of my countrymen
took place. I saw in them only the executioners
of my father and brother; I, therefore,
collected some young people of my acquaintance,
who were of the same mind as myself, and
joined those brave Mamelukes, who were so
often the terror of the French host. When
the campaign was finished, I could not make
up my mind to return to the peaceful arts.
With my little band of congenial friends, I
led a restless, careless life, devoted to the field
and the chase. I live contented among this
people, who honor me as their chief; for
though my Asiatics are not quite so refined
as your Europeans, yet are they far removed
from envy and slander, from selfishness and
ambition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Zaleukos thanked the stranger for his relation,
but did not conceal from him, that he
would find things better suited to his rank and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg&nbsp;219]</a></span>
education, if he would live and work in Christian,
in European lands. With delight his
companion looked upon him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know by this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that you have
entirely forgiven me, that you love me: receive,
in return, my heartfelt thanks.&rdquo; He
sprang up, and stood in full height before the
Greek, whom the warlike air, the dark sparkling
eyes, the deep mysterious voice of his
guest, almost inspired with fear. &ldquo;Thy proposal
is intended kindly,&rdquo; continued he; &ldquo;for
another it might have charms; but I&mdash;I cannot
accept it. Already stands my horse saddled:
already do my attendants await me.
Farewell, Zaleukos!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friends whom destiny had so strangely
thrown together, embraced at parting. &ldquo;And
how may I call thee? What is the name of
my guest, who will forever live in my remembrance?&rdquo;
exclaimed the Greek.</p>

<p>The stranger gazed at him some time, and
said, as he pressed his hand once more: &ldquo;They
call me &lsquo;the lord of the wilderness;&rsquo; I am <span class="smcap">the
Robber Orbasan</span>!&rdquo;</p>
